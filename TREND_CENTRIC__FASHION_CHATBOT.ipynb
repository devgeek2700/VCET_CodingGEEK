              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account  This weekend, Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding took place in Mumbai—and it seemed as if the whole world was watching. Thousands gathered in the streets of Mumbai to watch the son of India’s wealthiest man travel from the family home of Antilla to the Jio World Convention Center for his baraat. Millions more scrolled through on social media as Kim and Khloe Kardashian posted themselves in traditional Indian clothing with a camera crew in tow. (It’s rumored the family is shooting an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.) Meanwhile, news outlets from the New York Times to the BBC sent reporters to cover the affair, and tabloids churned out articles upon articles on the family’s every move. The fervor was understandable. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, and Nita Ambani, his wife, hosted a hastakshar for their son and his fiancée in March where Rihanna performed. In the late spring, they held grand parties for their son and his fiancée in both London and on a cruise ship that sailed the Mediterranean. One had to wonder: If the pre-wedding events were this grand, what would the actual wedding be like? Vogue was granted the world exclusive inside the event. Radhika says that their wedding weekend was chosen with the utmost intent. “The dates were strategically chosen from the 12th, 13th, and 14th of July upon the advice of our family pujari, who identified synchronic moments for our celebrations based on auspicious astrological alignments in both my charts as well as Anant’s,” she says. “It was a meticulous process.” Also a meticulous process? The planning: overseen by Nita Ambani alongside her daughter Isha Ambani and daughter-in-law Shloka Ambani. “My mother-in-law was the C.E.O. of the wedding, as I like to say,” says Radhika. “It was Nita’s commitment and vision that brought our entire celebration to life.” The family had several teams of event planners, as well as their in-house staff, working around the clock to orchestrate the multi-week affair. Their nuptials kicked off on July 5 with a sangeet—or, a pre-wedding event where both the bride, groom, and their families do choreographed dances on stages to symbolize their upcoming union. Radhika wore in a crystal outfit by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. (“I wanted to make a lasting impression,” she says.) Anant also opted for a look by Khosla, complete with ruby diamond buttons by Kantilal Chhotalal. Pinned on his chest was a cheetah brooch, a nod to his 3,000-acre animal rescue sanctuary Vantara in Gujarat. Isha, meanwhile, wore a custom Schiaparelli saree: a first for the French haute couture house. As the party grew late—and Justin Bieber took the stage for a private concert—Radhika changed into a metal mesh saree by Manish Malhotra. “It featured a corset that added a modern twist,” Radhika explains. “Although it was quite heavy, it was worth every moment.” Over the next few days, the couple had several poojas (or, ceremonial prayers) as well as a mehendi ceremony where the bride and her guests get their hands and feet painted with henna. Then on July 11, they held their haldi—an auspicious tradition when a soon-to-be-married couple is covered in turmeric paste for prosperity. Radhika wore sherara pants from Anamika Khanna and a dupatta (or, a stole) made of flowers. “The atmosphere was filled with joy—and a bit of chaos,” says Radhika. “Our haldi is what I hold most dear to me.” July 12 was the baraat, or, the groom’s wedding procession. Arriving at the Jio World Convention, there were musical performers and hundreds of dancers as Anant arrived on horseback. “It was out of this world. I’ve never seen anything like this,” designer Prabal Gurung, who was one of over 2,000 guests in attendance along with Tony Blair, Nick Jonas, and Priyanka Chopra, says of the baraat. “The whole room was filled with flowers and Bollywood celebrities. There was all this dancing and singing.” (Those flowers were orchestrated by event planner Preston Bailey, who made over 60 floral animal sculptures, made of Indian flowers, including monkeys, elephants, and tigers. He estimated each one took over 100,000 flowers to make. “It took many sleepless nights,” Bailey tells Vogue, who arrived in Mumbai three weeks ago in order to pull it off. Throughout the evening, people lined up to take photos in front of the installations.) After a short break, it was time for the wedding. The Hindu ceremony began with the traditional jaimala, where Anant and Radhika exchanged garlands symbolizing acceptance of one another. That was followed by the kanyadaan, or, the official moment where Radhika’s parents gave Anant their blessing to marry their daughter. Then came the phera: or, the actual wedding ceremony where the bride and groom take circumambulations around a ritual fire. Radhika describes the act as “somber yet mesmerizing.” “Each vow encompasses promises of love, fidelity, prosperity, and mutual respect, creating a foundation for our married life,” she says. Afterward came the sindoor daan and mangalsutra ceremonies, where Anant put vermillion in Radhika’s hair and tied a mangalsutra, or sacred necklace, around her neck. “This can be likened to the exchange of rings in a Western wedding,” Radhika explains. “The ceremony concluded with the aashirwad, where we sought blessings from our elders, ensuring their good wishes for our future.” For this holy moment, Radhika wore a one-of-a-kind couture look by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla in red and white, honoring the Gujarati tradition of panetar. Her ghagra was adorned with intricate floral motifs along with precious stones and sequins. Upon her head was a six-foot veil that had a delicate jaali pattern and cut-work. (“My veil was a true Zardozi marvel,” says Radhika, referencing the cultural term for gold thread embroidery.) A wedding portrait of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. Around her neck, she wore a multi-emerald ranihaar, or bridal necklace. Radhika tells Vogue the piece is a family heirloom: “I wore the same necklace my sister and aunts wore at their weddings, and I truly believe it gave me a special strength and blessing,” she says. The groom, meanwhile, wore Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Then, it was time for the bidaai—or, farewell ceremony for the bride as she leaves her family home to move into her marital home in Indian weddings. “It's considered a bittersweet and sentimental moment that marks the start of the bride's new life as a wife and the end of her role as a daughter,” Radhika explains. She changed into a custom red-and-gold lehenga by Manish Malhotra which featured a blouse from the Indian house’s archive that was over 100 years old. The bride also tells Vogue that her trousseau was a lifetime in the making: “There are looks—dresses and jewelry, which I have planned on with my mom and sister since I was a little girl; I haven’t paid much attention to trends,” she says. On Saturday, the Ambanis held a pooja to the goddess Saraswati. “For this day I wore my favorite outfit of the whole wedding—a ghagra painted by one of my favorite artists, Jayshree Burman in collaboration with Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla,” says Radhika. “Burman intricately painted an entire world within my ghagra with Lakshmi and Vishnu at the center,” The religious ceremony also attracted plenty of international press attention: India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, attended. Sunday was the Mangal Utsav: the couple’s wedding reception which was attended by over 14,000 people. Radhika wore a gold filigree corset from Dolce & Gabbana and a constructed saree from Anamika Khanna for the final event of her wedding weekend. Now that it’s all over, however, Radhika says she has an “overwhelming sense of fulfillment.” “We’ve been friends and confidants to one another for so long, and now we are finally embarking upon our official journey as a married couple,” she says of her marriage to Anant. “I can’t wait to see what our shared life has in store.” For the sangeet, which involves performing rehearsed dance choreographies on stage, I wanted to make a lasting impression. I turned to legendary Indian couturiers for two distinct looks. For my dance performances, I wore a stunning crystal outfit by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Together with Anant before the sangeet. Their creation sparkled brilliantly under the lights. Anant performing with my family. Akash Ambani, Anant's older brother. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Following her surprise appearance at Trooping the Colour in June, Kate Middleton took her seat in the Royal Box at Wimbledon today to watch Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz face off in the Gentlemen’s Singles Final. In a break from her usual SW19 style, the Princess of Wales wore a custom version of Safiyaa’s Cecilia dress in Wimbledon purple for her turn on Centre Court. Joining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch the match? Both Pippa Middleton and Princess Charlotte, who has reportedly been “really taking care of her mum” throughout her treatment. Kate has, of course, been a fixture in SW19 since joining the royal family 13 years ago, becoming Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2016. Not only is she one of the tournament’s most animated spectators, she’s also taken part in ball girl training with Roger Federer, and—following Emma Raducanu’s Grand Slam win in 2021—even had a lesson with the former British No 1 at the National Tennis Centre. Princess Charlotte wore polka dots for the outing, a favorite print of her mother’s. Still, there was doubt about whether Kate would be able to attend this year’s event. In an update on her health in June, the Princess wrote that, while she was “looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade,” she was “not out of the woods yet” when it came to her cancer treatment. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days, you feel weak, tired, and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” As for the Prince of Wales? As President of the Football Association, William traveled to Germany on Sunday to watch the Euros finals at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. And he isn’t the only Windsor who will be gripped by the match. “My wife and I join all our family in wishing you the warmest congratulations on reaching the final of the UEFA European Championship—and in sending our very best wishes for Sunday’s match,” the King wrote in a message to the England team after they defeated the Netherlands on Wednesday. “If I may encourage you to secure victory before the need for any last-minute wonder-goals or another penalties drama, I am sure the stresses on the nation’s collective heart rate and blood pressure would be greatly alleviated!” Meghan Markle Is Returning to Television Kate Middleton and Prince William Share a Never-Before-Seen Wedding Picture The Royal Family Have Been Lifestyle Influencers for Centuries The Greatest Royal Tiaras in History Are We Entering a New Era of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?

A classic since the 1990s, the marine scent is still as irresistible as a siren song—during the sale, it’s bundled into a set with an eau de toilette, an eau de parfum, and a miniature bottle of Aqua di Gio Profondo. And for those who like a little spice, the unexpected notes of Gucci’s Guilty Pour Homme prove just how well roses mix with hot chili peppers. (Who knew? Certainly, A$AP Rocky did.) Herewith, browse Vogue’s picks for the best perfumes and colognes on sale during the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, and prepare to elevate your every pulse point—at a much lower price point. But hurry: these deals won’t last for long.

Depop girlie Bella Hadid knew that Coach bags were due a comeback way before eBay searches for the all-American brand’s Ergo and Soho styles started peaking (eBay reports a 114 per cent surge since January). But, since graduating from her “recherché Y2K hype-girl” look to an urban cowgirl, adaptogenics entrepreneur and aspiring olfactor (Orabella’s Window2Soul scent is begging for your verdict), she needs more from a bag than the likes of @TimelessWear and @princesspeach310 can offer. In a savvy marketing move from Coach–which has already capitalized on interest in its vintage styles through its (Re)Loved program allowing customers to trade in, repair or upcycle accessories–has launched a new bag that looks vintage. Creative director Stuart Vevers–the man who revived the label from sleepy house to sleeper fashion hit–then gifted his Brooklyn bag to Bella. Pictures of the super with the sleek “hobo” model slung over the shoulder of her vintage tanks and Miaou polos hard-launched it as the style of summer. “Here Comes Trouble” reads Hadid’s vintage ribbed tank, which she styled with Gucci AW99 trousers, Femme Louis slippers, Alexis Bittar jewellery and that new Coach Brooklyn bag. Capris, crop tops and mules aren’t being exiled from the model’s wardrobe just yet. At first glance, the capacious, pliable silhouette has all the hallmarks of the fit-your-life-in slouchy styles of the Noughties, when bags were bequeathed rugged names, such as “Silverado” (Chloé) and “Gaucho” (Dior). Crafted from natural grain leather to emulate the “love-worn texture” of legacy Coach styles, Hadid’s inky black companion simultaneously looks old and has all the glossy newness that customers still want when faced with the prospect of shelling out $400 (a snip in the luxury market), or endless hours of scrolling on Vinted for that unicorn buy. The Brooklyn bag comes in black, maple, tan and dark lime colorways. And a smaller “28” model, retailing for £325, and a larger “39” iteration, with a price point of £495. On the fall 2024 runway, Vevers leaned into the appetite for forever fashion by presenting additional leather goods–including the Empire Carryall and Times Square Tabby–with distressed outers that suggest they have seen more adventures than Mary-Kate and Ashley’s beloved scratched and scuffed Balenciaga City totes. Proof they had, in fact, been round the block? The classic NYC souvenir keyrings–like Big Apples and mini Statue of Liberties–clipped onto the handles and clinking down the catwalk. For a 10th anniversary collection looking back as well as forecasting the brand’s future in a tough retail climate, there was something for everyone. Hadid, in her Tom Ford-era Gucci leather trousers, mules and stacked brassy gold jewelry, seems happy to go along for the ride. For a hot New York minute, Bella is back on a nostalgia trip and all is right in the world.

For cosmetics-lovers—and this includes bascially all Vogue editors—the arrival of the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale beauty deals is considered a summer holiday. As such, let us be the first to wish you a very happy Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2024. Open to the public now, the sale runs through August 3. The upshot? Need-them-now wardrobe and beauty essentials will be even more desirable for weeks to come—because they’re available at a steal. This year, in the beauty aisle, markdowns grace coveted goods from Augustinus Bader, NuFace, Oribe, and more. (At the risk of causing heart palpitations, dare we mention that Charlotte Tilbury’s Pillow Talk lip kit is also on sale?) Before you grab your smelling salts, take heed: We’ve done all the ruthless editing so that you can do all the giddy shopping. Herewith, find our cheat sheet for the crème de la crème Nordstrom Anniversary Sale beauty bits for face, hair, and body. We won’t even be mad if you beat us to checkout. Though you can’t toss a destination spa in your cart during the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale (not yet, at least), you can get that fresh-off-a-mountain retreat radiance. Thanks to the best beauty tools, sculpted cheekbones, spotless pores, and even firmer thighs can all be achieved at home. The sale is the ideal time to harness the firming and toning power of Vogue’s favorite microcurrent device, the NuFace Trinity+.\\xa0“Whenever I want to immediately look snatched, I grab my NuFace without fail,” Vogue’s senior beauty shopping writer Kiana Murden has remarked. To take the snatching head-to-toe, put BeautyBio’s Afterglo set to the test. Stocked with microneedling treatments for the face and body, the set can smooth and firm the skin everywhere, from the cheeks to the thighs, all without an ounce of pain. (It’s true—nary a Vogue editor yelped during trials.) Speaking of painless but effective tools, you can chill, Netflix, and boost your collagen in one go with Dr. Dennis Gross’s hands-free mask. Clinically proven to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and treat acne, the celebrity-approved LED face mask has been bundled with dermatologist-designed skin care for the sale. Dr. Gross’s beloved Alpha Beta peel, Vogue’s pick for the best pore-minimizing peel, is included in the kit—and the sale has plenty of other tools that will give that practically poreless, blurred-skin effect. For example? The PMD Personal Microderm Elite Pro Exfoliation Device is a favorite of medical esthetician Jordana Mattioli, who previously explained to Vogue that the device has spinning microdermabrasion discs to polish the face, while suction frees the pores from debris. For more complexion TLC, Dermaflash’s two-in-one tool extracts blackheads, dirt, oil, and debris from the pores while infusing the skin with glow-boosting ingredients. For the hair, T3’s single-pass tool uses customized heat settings to style the mane while banishing frizz and amping up shine.  Trinity+ Smart Advanced Facial Toning Starter Kit NORDSTROM Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro LED Light Therapy Device & Skin Care Set NORDSTROM BeautyBio Head to Toe Afterglo GloPRO Set NORDSTROM PMD Personal Microderm Elite Pro Exfoliation Device NORDSTROM Dermaflash Dermapore Ultrasonic Pore Extactor+ Skincare Infuser NORDSTROM T3 SinglePass StyleMax Flat Iron NORDSTROM It’s rare to find discounts on the very skin-care items that dermatologists, Vogue editors, and celebrities hoard, but the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale 2024 is one such occasion. As such, now is the perfect time to stock up on goods that will get you the glowiest skin of your life—starting with a deep, makeup-and-dirt-eviscerating cleanse with Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm. On sale in a jumbo format, the perennial favorite features a blend of brown algae, elderberry, and starflower oils to soften, tone, and restore elasticity to the skin. Pro tip: Use it as a weekly mask for deep nourishment and hydration. Or, if your skin’s a bit oilier, spend your mask nights with Kiehl’s Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque. It tamps down shine, refines the appearance of pores, and earned a spot on Vogue’s list of the best skincare products of 2024. No glow is sufficiently resplendent without regular exfoliation, and Sunday Riley’s Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment has been known to plump, brighten, and clarify the complexion in a mere 15 minutes. Fortified with soothing arnica and prickly pear extract, it’s the rare exfoliant that’s suited to sensitive skin, so grab the (discounted) jumbo bottle while you can. Other top-of-the-line treatments that are on sale include Dr. Barbara Sturm’s serums. Nordstrom’s special set pairs the Hyaluronic Serum and Glow Drops for an instant boost of celebrity-approved radiance. (The latter is a key element of Hailey Bieber’s “favorite, beachy glowy makeup look.”) When it comes to moisturizers, dermatologists, beauty editors, and Eva Longoria alike swear by Augustinus Bader The Rich Cream—during the sale, you can try it yourself for nearly $100 less. Finally, most would agree that SPF is nonnegotiable. But even those who try to resist it (or make it at home) find it tough to find a flaw in Supergoop’s Unseen formulation. On sale in a stick-and-bottle set, the SPF 40 melts into all skin tones without a trace and also works as a makeup primer.  Mini Miracle Creme Set NORDSTROM Augustinus Bader The Rich Cream Duo NORDSTROM Kiehl's Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Face Mask NORDSTROM Elemis Jumbo Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm NORDSTROM Kate Somerville ExfoliKate Cleanser Daily Foaming Wash NORDSTROM Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Jumbo + Go Set NORDSTROM Dr. Barbara Sturm SturmGlow Serum Essentials Set NORDSTROM Sunday Riley Jumbo Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Exfoliating Face Treatment NORDSTROM Your summer beauty plans may include a cult-classic lip color, a bronze-metallic eye, or a golden-peach pop of color on the cheeks. But why choose just one? Thanks to the Nordstrom Anniversary sale beauty deals, you can hit your next pool party or destination wedding, flaunting all three makeup essentials and still have enough to splurge on the dress. (Or save—plenty of party-ready looks are on sale at Nordstrom, too.) With coveted makeup on sale, now is the time to find out why Charlotte Tilbury’s Pillow Talk lipstick is an enduring celebrity favorite. The pinkish-nude hue is so beloved, in fact, that The Bear’s Molly Gordon previously told Vogue: “The least original thought ever: I’m a Pillow Talk girl.” Buy the cult-loved lipstick during the sale, and you’ll get it in a set with the matching liner and gloss. Also on the lip tip, Vogue’s beauty editor-at-large Arden Fanning Andrews wore Dior’s Addict Lip Glow Balm to her wedding—and didn’t stop there. “I wear it all over my face!” she confessed. A full-size version of the balm, a lash-primer serum, and a Diorshow mascara are all tucked inside Dior’s Natural Glow Makeup set. The volumizing mascara will dramatize any look created with Yves Saint Laurent’s eyeshadow palette—a mix of rosy, bronzy, and metallic hues—while Anastasia Beverly Hills Deluxe Brow Kit will leave the arches photoshoot-ready. (After all, Kendall Jenner calls Anastasia’s pencil her “tried-and-true” trick for top-model brows.) A lit-from-within flush provides just the finish for any summer makeup look, and you can take your pick from powder or cream. The Hourglass Ambient Lighting Face Palette has photoluminescent technology to give the skin a rosy, soft-focus glow, while Westman Atelier’s Bronze Trio gives an instant, just-back-from-the-beach flush. And finally, Sigma’s makeup brush set will ensure any makeup products blend with ease, whereas Bobbi Brown’s lip plumpers provide the ultimate finishing touch. Dior Natural Glow Makeup Set NORDSTROM Hourglass Ambient Lighting Face Palette Edit: Golden Rose NORDSTROM Westman Atelier The Summer Bronze Trio NORDSTROM Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Lip Kit NORDSTROM Anastasia Beverly Hills Natural & Polished Deluxe Eyebrow Kit NORDSTROM Yves Saint Laurent Couture Color Clutch Eyeshadow Palette NORDSTROM Bobbi Brown Extra Plump Hydrating Lip Serum Duo NORDSTROM Sigma Beauty Soft Coverage Brush Set NORDSTROM That fresh-from-the-salon bounce in your step (and your hair) feels almost as good as getting a great deal. During the Anniversary Sale, get a dual rush by scoring savings on hair care more commonly found backstage at photoshoots and fashion shows than in the sale aisle. To wit: Bumble and Bumble Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil facilitated spectacular textures and styles at Vogue World: Paris, while Oribe’s cult-classic texturizing spray is Fanning Andrews’ forever top pick “after a decade of trying them all.” Before styling, any eye-catching coif needs a good cleanse, and Virtue’s Recovery Shampoo not only leaves hair salon-fresh and soft—it contains a patented protein that repairs damaged strands. On that note, Olaplex’s No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner can be used daily to repair damaged hair, keep frizz at bay, and douse your mane with a little shine. For days when a wash just isn’t in the cards, though, Living Proof’s Perfect Hair Day dry shampoo is just the thing for a faux, freshly washed look. Plus, according to pro hairstylist Karen Miller, it’s perfect for curls. “This absorbs the oils and leaves the curls feeling refreshed and doesn’t flake up,” she told Vogue. Perfect, indeed! Between washes, styling, and the fuss-free days of dry shampoo, there’s scalp health to consider. (After all, scalp care is hair care.) Briogeo’s Scalp Saviors set pairs a handheld scalp massager with a coconut-charcoal micro-exfoliating shampoo, which is clinically proven to improve scalp hydration. Remember: scalp health is the ticket to hair growth. Speaking of growth, you may be looking for longer, fuller lashes and brows too. Fortunately, some of the best eyelash growth serums and brow growth serums by NeuLash and Revitalash are on sale during the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, too. Here’s to good hair days ahead. Revitalash Lash & Brows Conditioner Set NORDSTROM NeuLash Lash Enhancing Serum Duo Set NORDSTROM Virtue Recovery Shampoo NORDSTROM Olaplex No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner NORDSTROM Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray Duo Set NORDSTROM Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo Duo NORDSTROM Briogeo Scalp Saviors Set NORDSTROM  Hairdresser's Invisible Oil Hydrating Shampoo NORDSTROM During the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, shopping for the best fragrance deals has become common practice for beauty editors—fragrancing many an air kiss between industry insiders. The classic Baccarat Rouge 540, for example, comes in the exclusive Maison Francis Kurkdjian Paris discovery set. Another classic? Chloė Signature eau de parfum, which smells alluringly airy, pairing feminine scents of peony, magnolia flower, lily of the valley, and rose. If it’s flowers you’re after, you may also consider plucking a bottle of Diptyque Eau de Rose from the sale. “I love how light and easy the smell is,” senior market editor Naomi Elizée said, adding that, crucially, this rose is “not overpowering.” Add to the floral bouquet with finds from Le Labo’s Discovery Set, which includes travel-friendly bottles of the lavender-infused Lavande 31 and the jasmine-spiked Another 13—the wildly popular Santal 33 is in the set, too. There’s a reason “half of New York City wears Santal 33,” as creative development senior associate Lucy Dolan-Zalaznick has noted—the woody homage to the American West has a way of casting a spell on even the most sophisticated scent-lovers. Another taste of the West makes its way into Byrdeo’s Les Triplés Fragrance Set, which contains miniature bottles of the brand’s most beloved scents, including the desert-inspired Mojave Ghost eau de parfum. From the (not-so-wild) West to far-flung resorts, Tom Ford’s trio of Private Blend Soleil fragrances channel sun-dappled getaways steeped in white-sand beaches. Maison Francis Kurkdjian Fragrance Wardrobe for Her Set NORDSTROM Byredo Les Triples Fragrance Set NORDSTROM Tom Ford Private Blend Soleil Fragrance Travel Set & Atomizer NORDSTROM Diptyque Eau Rose Eau de Parfum Set NORDSTROM Le Labo The Discovery Set NORDSTROM Chloé Signature Eau de Parfum Gift Set NORDSTROM To take the preening from head to toe, add a few of the best body-care deals to your Nordstrom Anniversary Sale cart. The Osea Golden Glow Discovery Set not only contains the Undaria Algae Body Butter, which landed on our best body lotions list because it instantly transforms dry, crepey skin; it also has a supermodel’s secret weapon. Abby Champion told Vogue that she smooths the Undarian Algae Body Oil on her neck to keep it crease-free. Like your oil with a little glimmer? Now is the time to pick up Tom Ford’s shimmering body oil. Infused with sparkle-inducing flecks of platinum and gold, the bergamot, pistachio, and coco-de-mer scented oils were an undisputed pick for our list. A bit of sparkle shines brighter against a bronzed backdrop—conveniently, the St. Tropez bronzing mousse is also on sale. Everyday essentials get a glamorous spin in Nordstrom’s sale aisles too. Consider a natural deodorant from Salt & Stone, beloved by Vogue editors for its skin-loving formulation infused with seaweed extracts, hyaluronic acid, and nourishing oils. For body washes, Nėcessaire’s eucalyptus-scented Body Wash Duo takes simple cleansing up a notch with skincare-grade ingredients including niacinamide and vitamins A, C, and E. Hand care counts, too, and L’Occitane’s shea butter hand cream has long been a Vogue-editor favorite. Tried and true, the French cream leaves hands soft, hydrated, and smelling of jasmine and ylang-ylang. Osea Golden Glow Discovery Set NORDSTROM Salt & Stone Santal & Vetiver Deodorant Duo NORDSTROM Nécessaire The Body Wash Duo NORDSTROM Tom Ford Shimmering Body Oil Set NORDSTROM St. Tropez Self Tan Express Bronzing Mousse Home & Away Set NORDSTROM L’Occitane Shea Hand Classics Set NORDSTROM An utterly cozy blanket, a divinely scented candle, elevated dental essentials—the best wellness deals at the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale ensure that your surroundings and spirit will get a glow-up along with your skin, body, and hair. (Not to mention, your teeth.) Why not stay hydrated—32 ounces at a time—with a sleek, wide-mouth bottle from Hydro Flask? Or, brighten your smile with the Moon teeth-whitening device system? To keep the good habits going, ensure proper beauty sleep with Slip's beloved silk pillowcases fortunately on sale or UGG’s throw-blanket-and-sleep-mask set. Made of plush faux shearling, the sweet-dream facilitator comes with a convenient carry bag that makes it easy to doze on the go. Speaking of dreamy things, Pura’s collaboration with Brooklyn Candle fills the home with scents ranging from jasmine-gardenia-laced Sunday Morning to Love Potion, which melds jasmine with lavender and mandarin. All the scents are housed in Pura’s smart plug-in, which can be controlled via smartphone. But if you prefer a more traditional route to home fragrance, consider Diptyque’s 4-Piece Candle Gift Set, which lends itself to candlelit moments fragranced with rose, fig, lavender, or berries. Ugg Original Faux Shearling Throw Blanket & Eye Mask Sleep Set NORDSTROM Slip Set of 2 Silk Queen Pillowcases NORDSTROM Diptyque 4-Piece Candle Gift Set NORDSTROM Pura x Brooklyn Candle Best Sellers & Pura 4 Smart Fragrance Diffuser & Refill Set NORDSTROM Moon The Teeth Whitening Device System NORDSTROM Hydro Flask 32-Ounce Wide Mouth Flex Straw Cap Water Bottle NORDSTROM 60+ skincare, makeup, hair, and fragrance picks. 14 Best LED Face Masks, According to Dermatologists and Vogue Editors The Best Korean Skin Care Products of 2024 Loved By K-Beauty Experts The Best At-Home Laser Hair Removal Devices, According to Experts 11 Best Hair Growth Serums for Long, Strong Hair From NuFace to Currentbody, the Best Beauty Tools Deliver a Glowing, Sculpted Appearance 13 Best Moisturizers With SPF That Effortlessly Combine Hydration With Sun Protection The Tried-And-True Skin-Care Products Vogue Editors Swear By The Best Wrinkle Creams That Actually Work, According to Skin Care Experts More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. You’re not supposed to be depressed in summer. What’s not to love? Long twilights, endless weddings, fresh strawberries, truly enormous hats. For most people, this is the high point of their year, a moment of breezy freedom, when they look at the world through rosé-tinted glasses. But not me. When the sun hits, so does my anxiety, and I become a hot mess of self-loathing—Lana del Rey’s “Summertime Sadness” personified. At first glance, this doesn’t make a lot of sense. More sunlight means more vitamin D, which helps to boost our mood. That’s one of several reasons so many people battle Seasonal Affective Disorder—often shortened to the slightly tactless acronym SAD—in the winter, a recurrent form of depression that comes on during the colder, darker months. It’s thought to be linked to reduced exposure to sunlight, which affects the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that helps to produce melatonin and serotonin.So why does my depression flare up in the run-up to the summer solstice? Well, it turns out that the “seasonal” element of SAD doesn’t solely refer to winter. You can actually experience SAD in the summer, too, when you’re meant to be capital letters HAPPY. This is sometimes referred to as “Reverse SAD” and is thought to make up about a tenth of total SAD cases. Data suggests it can have tragic consequences; suicide rates actually peak in spring and summer, not autumn and winter. The science behind seasons’ effect on our mood is still hazy, but it’s believed that higher temperatures can lead to our neurotransmitters going haywire. Pollen might also play a part, leading to inflammation among those with allergies. What’s much clearer, though, is how our lifestyles contribute to summer blues. Many of us eat poorly, drink excessively, and miss out on sleep between June and August, leaving us more frazzled than usual. (Insider tip: waking up with hangxiety and five quid in your bank account every Monday for three months on end can leave you feeling less than 100%.) And, for me, summer also brings—no judgment if you cringe here—FOMO, which is much more intense than usual when everyone around you is seemingly having the time of their lives. Some of my most crushing SAD episodes have seen me festering in bed after flaking on a festival, feeling like I was enduring the collective comedown of an entire field of ravers while my friends had fun outside. “Especially if I’m having a low day, sunny weather makes me angry, and then I feel pathetic for feeling like this when no one else understands,” Lucie, a fellow Reverse SAD sufferer, tells me. “I feel guilty for wasting the nice weather, and don’t want to bring other people’s mood down.” Admittedly, I’ve always been particularly pathetic in the heat, retreating to the shade every 15 minutes like a vampire to avoid heatstroke. It also didn’t help that I was on SSRIs for the best part of a decade, which can reduce your tolerance for high temperatures and make you more prone to exhaustion. Plus, literal cold take: I actually don’t mind winter. I totally get that sleet, flu, and seemingly eternal darkness isn’t for everyone, especially those with typical SAD, but wearing multiple layers, eating comfort food, and hiding away in bed makes me feel much warmer inside. I’m secretly a little happy that the solstice is here, meaning that we’re already spinning our way towards colder climes. Maybe, for those of us with midsummer melancholia, the best solution is to simply ignore what other people get up to when the mercury rises. Enjoy what you can of the weather, when you can, without giving into the pressure to have “the best summer ever.” With this in mind, hopefully I can sit back, relax, and enjoy the sun come August. From a distance, in the sanctity of the shade, that is.

Ever since she launched Homecourt in 2022, Cox has been dreaming up a scent inspired by her daughter. “Not just because she\\'s my daughter, but also because she\\'s such a special person.” Today, the collection is officially here. “I\\'m blushing,” Arquette says of this tribute, named Cocomoi. “My mom is my rock, my best friend.” It\\'s not just a weaving of marketing magic to say that Arquette\\'s Cocomoi is the daughter scent of Cox\\'s namesake juice with the brand, Cece. Much like the mother-daughter duo, the two blends have notes in common: sweet cardamom, cedarwood, and vetivier. “I wanted it to be familial,” Cox shares. “We are similar human beings,\" Arquette says of her relationship with her mother. “We\\'re both sensitive and emotional, but also really spunky.” On top of the mother-daughter earthy notes, Cocomoi also has tropical coconut water and black pepper to make it unique. The scent is green in a youthful way, it\\'s tropical in a sexy beach vacation way. The 5-piece collection starts with a candle in the brand\\'s iconic minimalist ceramic vessel candle. This is also Homecourt\\'s first full-fledged body collection, with other beachy products including perfume oil, body mist, body butter, and body wash. “I love being the Homecourt heiress,” Arquette jokes during our time together. “My apartment always smells incredible.” When Cox launched the brand, comparisons to her super type-a character Monica Geller were easy. “I\\'ve never watched [Friends] all the way through,” Arquette confesses. “It\\'s kind of odd, she\\'s like always making out with men. That\\'s a little too much for me! But, I do think that she\\'s very similar to her character. She\\'s not as high-strung, but just as spunky. And then with the cleaning aspect, thank God for the Surface Cleaner. Because one, it smells so good, but also the amount that she\\'s spraying all the time, thank God it\\'s nice and natural.” By signing up you agree to our User Agreement (including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Vogue.

The mission of Vogue World is to bring together the fashion industry in a spirit of creativity to celebrate a host city. When Vogue World launched in 2022, it unfolded in downtown New York City as a street-fair-slash-fashion-show in an effort to inspire the New York fashion community. Models graced an openair runway, Lil Nas X performed while flanked by the Hadid sisters, Fendi offered baguettes, and pastrami sandwiches were served courtesy of Michael Kors and Katz’s Deli. In 2023, Vogue World: London was reimagined as an opening night in the West End, at the historic Theatre Royal Drury Lane: Annie Lennox serenaded the crowd with “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),” FKA Twigs sang alongside Rambert dancers, Stormzy and Sophie Okonedo performed Shakespeare and The Supermodels—Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington—took a surprise walk down the runway.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Though the 2010s aren’t too far behind, a look back reveals how much things have changed—especially in fashion. The single most impactful 2010s fashion development did not come from Milan, New York, or Paris, but from Silicon Valley. We’re talking about Instagram. For much of history, sartorial innovations have had to do with advancements in textile technology or with new silhouettes that suddenly exaggerated or revealed certain parts of the human form. (With nylon came the faux silk stockings of the 1940s; with spandex came the stretch jeans of the 1970s. The 1950s brought us conical bras; the 1960s brought us miniskirts; the 1980s brought us padded shoulders.) Very few fashion milestones have had nothing to do with fashion—that is, until Instagram was born. Now everyone has an audience! Dressing for Instagram meant wearing statement-making pieces that photographed well. It also led to a rise in fast fashion, as those posting about their style needed a variety of trendy pieces for an endless parade of outfit-of-the-day shots. If an ensemble looked good on camera, did it really matter if it wasn’t the highest quality? No one will know! This decade also included the casual-ification of fashion with athleisure (the word was added to the dictionary in 2015) and streetwear (Louis Vuitton’s collaboration with Supreme cemented the genre’s place in high fashion in 2017), but lest we forget, there were also plenty of ways to dress up in the 2010s. The operative word being up, of course—sky-high platform pumps were the dominant shoe, and they were worn with peplum dresses and pencil skirts. Fashion is a pendulum that swings back and forth. A brief fashion history lesson of the 2010s below. Insta-style: Dressing for “the ’gram.” Like time, fashion ticks along. It’s always moving forward, but there are moments when fashion makes quantum leaps toward the future with breakneck speed, and a whole new direction is set. With the social media app’s arrival in 2010 came rapid-speed visual communication between fashion lovers, brands, and customers. Suddenly, trends and new fashions could be disseminated like never before. If New York’s fashion set used to get dressed for Bill Cunningham (the street style photographer passed away in 2016), they were now getting dressed for “the ’gram.” In the late aughts, fashion bloggers were on the rise, and after Instagram’s launch, they immediately adopted the app as their main platform. The Blonde Salad, the Man Repeller, the Style Bubble, and Gary Pepper Girl (as they were known on their blogs) eventually rebranded on Instagram to Chiara Ferragni, Leandra Medine Cohen, Susie Lau, and Nicole Warne, respectively. Few could help themselves from peacocking for the cameras, and the trend of documenting outfits on Instagram coincided with a rise of maximalist, color-packed, power-clashing getups. The way an outfit was uniquely styled was as important (if not more so) than the brands that were worn. The decade kicked off with fashion followers in a completely beguiled state; Alexander McQueen’s last runway show, spring/summer 2010 known as Plato’s Atlantis, had mesmerized viewers. Among his wondrous final collection (the designer would pass in February of 2010), were a pair of animalistic, bulbous shoes with a skinny, curved heel dubbed the Armadillo. The fantastical footwear was instantly donned by fashion eccentrics like Lady Gaga and Daphne Guinness. The Armadillo shoe arrived at the sky-high height of the platform-shoe craze. At the start of the 2010s, heels were a popular choice for work and everyday, and Christian Louboutin’s red-bottom heels reigned. For a heel to be considered fashion-forward in this era, it had to have a platform. Saint Laurent’s Tribute Sandal and Louboutin’s Very Privé Peep-Toe were the era’s It shoes. (The trend petered out as the mid-2010s approached; Gen Z favored sneakers above all else.) In a cheeky article in Vogue’s January 2013 issue, Lynn Yaeger writes: “You’ve spent the last decade clomping, somehow managing to convince yourself that when you don your cherished platforms—so reliable, so comfy—you are, in your own way, sort of gliding. You are not. Amazonian footwear may have its virtues, but delicacy and grace are not among them. So you would think, then, that the news that thin-soled shoes with a quiet elegance fit for a sylph were wafting their way into wardrobes this season would be universally met with at least measured enthusiasm. But “no!” you declare, clinging ever more tightly to your clunkers as you galumph through life. Change is hard!” With Jenna Lyons at the helm of J.Crew from 2003 through April 2017, a new look emerged. While it technically didn’t have a name, “the J.Crew look” was easily recognizable. The label produced many of the trend’s components with aplomb. Think: peplum tops, collared shirts, candy-colored bubble necklaces, pastel-colored skinny pants, and knee-length pencil skirts. The foundation of this trend were office-wear classics that were updated in candy colors and restyled with an out-of-office ease: striped T-shirts mixed with belted camouflage jackets, denim button-up shirts layered with bright pink cashmere cardigans, a sparkly necklace peeking out from beneath the collar of a tailored blazer. The aesthetic was adopted as a go-to look for women of all ages, who topped it all off with a sock bun hairdo, naturally. In 2015, Merriam-Webster added the word athleisure to its dictionary. However, the term, which was defined as “casual clothing designed to be worn both for exercising and for general use,” was in use before it was brought into the Merriam-Webster canon of words. The term was first used in Vogue in an article (“Fashion Pumps it Up” ) in 1995: “The fitness revolution not only wrought better-looking, higher-performance workout wear, it sent sports gear out of the gym, off the hiking trail, into the street, and, recently, onto the runway.” But it wasn’t used again until 2015, in an article by Hamish Bowles on the launch of Tory Burch’s Tory Sport line. “Of course, athleisure has lately become a fashion buzzword, a term intended to embrace the kind of clothing that a woman might be able to wear at work, to the gym, and then to dinner. “This didn’t feel like a trend to me,” Tory says of the moment when she noticed that her friends in London were wearing yoga pants with a smart blazer to Cipriani for lunch.” Burch’s line came at the perfect time. By the 2010s, the term yoga pants was only a suggestion, spandex needn’t ever be sweat in, sneakers paired well with party dresses, and sporty stripes became as classic as a Breton. By the 2010s, the fashion industry was mad for collabs—the nuttier and zanier, the better. The industry had tired of the obvious high-low collaborations (which can be traced back to 2004, when Karl Lagerfeld partnered with H&M) and it needed to raise eyebrows and get heads scratching in order to stand out even more. Attention spans were shrinking at a breakneck speed due to the volume of available information and entertainment on the internet, and designers learned they could dangle a new shiny (but weird!) collaboration or capsule collection in the public’s faces to hold their attention—even if only for a week or less. This was not a collaboration per se, but in January of 2011, Givenchy’s then creative director, Ricardo Tisci, sent tees and hoodies printed with the menacing face of a snarling rottweiler. Hard to ignore, these pieces were startling, and beyond that, they were seemingly without reason at all! (What did a rottweiler have to do with the House of Givenchy? Nothing! So random!) Naturally they were a wild success. They were worn by celebrities (Kanye West, Liv Tyler, Kendall Jenner, Rihanna) ad nauseam. It was a turning point. Soon fashion was offering more out-of-the-box merch, and designers and brands often formed collaborations with notable people or other brands to launch them. In 2017, the world was graced with several: Christopher Kane’s collaboration with Crocs (back then, a persona non grata if brands were people), Supreme x Louis Vuitton, and oddball mash-up with Champion, Juicy Couture, Levi’s, and more for Vetements (then helmed by brothers Demna and Guram Gvasalia). High fashion’s collabs with non-fashion (or unfashionable) brands were like a breath of fresh air. In 2018 came DHL x Vetements. That same year, Balenciaga by Demna introduced World Food Programme x Balenciaga, and Ugg collabed with Y/Project. A slick black dress is sublime, but if an iPhone camera can’t convey the sumptuous simplicity of it all, why bother? Colorful more-is-more dressing looked great for the camera, and the 2010s were all about photogenic dressing. Within the fashion world, peacocking outside fashion shows in look-at-me outfits became standard practice. Beyond that, Instagram users took to posting their ensembles in #OOTD posts. No designer represented this trend more than Alessandro Michele, who succeeded Frida Giannini as creative director of Gucci. If Gucci’s ready-to-wear business was born with Tom Ford’s sex-on-a-stick pieces, Michele flipped the house codes on its head, doing granny-chic meets Wes Anderson meets glam rock. Michele’s Gucci was covered up (a chiffon maxi dress topped with a fair-isle V-neck finished with a Peter Pan collar) and intellectually quirky. Michele promoted styling and an outré mix of patterns. After the skinny jean craze of the aughts (which peaked when brands started offering them in pastel shades), pants loosened up. Dubbed the mom jean, they were cut with a baggier fit, like a boyfriend jean, but sat higher on the waist; the denim silhouette was a go-to. It was worn to the office, the bar, and everywhere in between. Meanwhile, so-called dad sneakers broke out onto the fashion scene with a fervor. The unending nostalgia for the ’90s and the decade’s thick-sole white sneaker—like something worn by someone’s unfashionable father—became a fashion item. Demna promoted the style at Balenciaga’s Fall 2017 menswear presentation, which debuted the Balenciaga Triple S Sneakers (named for the three soles layered on top of one another). The clunky shoe inspired countless copycats and ushered in the era of the “ugly shoe.” Prada, Bottega Venetta, Loewe, Chloé, Balenciaga, Burberry, Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Jacobs, Versace, Miu Miu, Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Fendi, Tom Ford, Gucci, Martin Margiela, Dries Van Noten, Vivienne Westwood, Comme des Garçons’ Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto, John Galliano, Chanel, Oscar de la Renta, Kenzo, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Michael Kors, Moschino, Alaïa, Lanvin, Roberto Cavalli, Stella McCartney, Viktor & Rolf, Gareth Pugh, Christopher Kane, Rodarte, Phillip Lim, Jason Wu, Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin, Nina Ricci, Raf Simmons, Lanvin, Virgil Abloh, Erdem, Jonathan Anderson The aforementioned women’s trend of “the J.Crew look” of the late aughts and early 2010s was also one in which men fully patrook. For them, there were no peplums or bubble necklaces, but J.Crew’s robust assortment of mid-century suiting in the colors of navy, caramel, and linen. A navy suit worn with brown loafers and colorful socks was the fashionisto’s uniform. The inspiration here can be sourced directly back to Mad Men, which premiered in 2007 and instantly enraptured the world. By 2011, Banana Republic capitalized on the appeal by releasing its own collaboration with Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant to offer a new collection of 1960s-inspired fashions. Men not swayed by mid-century swank adopted athleisure and streetwear fashion. Supreme had a chokehold on this generation, inspiring people to queue up for hours for irreverent Supreme-branded merch. By June of 2017, Supreme and Louis Vuitton teamed up; the NYC-based skatewear brand splashed its name all over Vuitton’s iconic pieces and luxury classics. In 2015, the clothing released by Kanye West at his Yeezy Season 2 presentation embraced a minimalist color palette in powdery earthy tones. By 2018, Virgil Abloh was named artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear. This appointment cemented streetwear’s role in high fashion. In the late 2010s, and fueled by the collabs from Demna for Balenciaga and Vetements, the decade closed out the fashionable man sporting dad-sneakers and a relaxed tee. Instagram’s launch in 2010 almost instantly rewired the world. Communication was image-based, and now everything was worth a snap. A slew of “disrupting” tech start-ups (Uber in 2009, Doordash in 2013, Airbnb in 2008), promised convenience and comfort and heralded the rise of a new “gig economy.” Music-wise, in 2010 Lady Gaga turned up to the VMAs in a meat dress, and in 2013, Miley Cyrus’s twerking VMA performance went viral. In 2016, Beyoncé dropped her visual album Lemonade on an unsuspecting world. In 2011, Kate Middleton married Prince William while wearing Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, just a year after Lee Alexander McQueen tragically passed. By the summer of 2014, everyone was pouring chilly water on themselves for the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise awareness for ALS. In 2016, Hamilton arrived on Broadway and the world fell for the historical hip-hop era. In 2015, a racial reckoning in the entertainment industry took hold as the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite trended. Two years later, sexual misconduct in Hollywood (and elsewhere) was given attention with the #MeToo movement and revelations against Harvey Weinstein. TikTok launched in 2017, helping to birth the 2019 hit “Old Town Road,” which was the earworm of the decade.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. If one moment sums up early-2000s fashion, it was February 2000: Jennifer Lopez wore a chiffon Versace dress to the 42nd Grammy Awards, and the world was never the same. With a neckline that plunged all the way below her belly button, the world was in a tizzy—but how did it stay on? And what did it look like from the side? Everyone wanted to see the dress! So much so that it inspired the idea of Google Image Search. And so began a decade of digital fashion consumption. Dubbed the aughts and the naughts (the former used in the US, the latter in the UK), the decade was ruled by celebrity: a proliferation of reality TV, blogs filled with paparazzi shots, and 2006’s Twitter, which gave fans a front-row seat into the lives and musings of their favorite celebrities—often without a publicist’s intervention. Regarding mainstream fashion, it was a decade of taste so bad it was almost good—almost. Think Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears in matching denim getups, Juicy Couture sweatsuits galore, Von Dutch trucker hats, and Ed Hardy tattoo tees. On the runways, logomania ruled, and designers sexed it up with Tom Ford, Donatella Versace, Roberto Cavalli, and Hervé Léger infusing heady doses of sultry into their collections. A whirlwind look back at the in-your-face trends of early-2000s fashion, below. If eyes are the window to the soul, by the time the 2000s rolled around so too were handbags. Thanks in part to a certain Ms. Carrie Bradshaw, bags became the focal point of an outfit. After the launch of Fendi’s Baguette in 1997 (as fashion lore goes, the bag, designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi, was initially unpopular among the Fendi design team, who feared it had too much personality during a minimalist-fashion era), it skyrocketed to handbag stardom and is often considered fashion’s first It bag. Bradshaw, of course, famously carried multiple iterations of the Baguette throughout Sex and the City’s fabulous six-season run. In the 2000s each brand had a white-hot bag (or two) that fashion folk clamored to carry. As mentioned, Fendi had its carb-inspired Baguette; Balenciaga had its slouchy Motorcycle City Bag, introduced in 2001 by then creative director Nicolas Ghesquière; Chloé had its boho Paddington bag, created by then creative director Phoebe Philo in 2005; Galliano debuted the Saddle bag at Dior’s spring-summer 2000 show. And over at Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs was cranking out It bag after It bag with clever collaborations. Artists were invited to make interventions with Vuitton’s storied monogram: In 2001, it was Stephen Sprouse’s graffiti collection; in 2003, it was Takashi Murakami’s smiley flower-and-cherry collections. These bags were not to go unnoticed: statement making, eye-catching, and the center of attention! In 2002, Sarah Mower charted the rise of the It bag in Vogue’s October issue: “In about 1993, fashionettes everywhere wanted the identical item at the same time (a Kate Spade shopper, a sporty Prada knapsack). Then came the great Baguette hunt for exotic hide and fabric varieties (a standard shape, but now in individualistic surface patterns). Before long, thanks to Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Dior, we were buying entire bag wardrobes, toting them as up-to- the-split-second status trophies.” “Fashion is pushing its love affair with logos to the limit. If you’ve got it, flaunt it!” wrote Vogue in its March 2000 issue. All the aforementioned It bags were typically brandished with a logo—but that didn’t stop there! Dior’s bikinis featured their Oblique monogram; Burberry checked just about every object that could be checked; Gucci’s double Gs festooned belt buckles; and Marc Jacobs even painted his naked body with the neon pink Louis Vuitton logos inspired by LV’s collab with Stephen Sprouse in 2008 for an ad campaign. If early-2000s fashion had a square inch to spare, it was filled with an alphabet city of letters. Tongue-in-cheek nods to this super-trend were made; in the brilliant March 2000 editorial “Branded” for Vogue, Helmut Newton took model Angela Lindvall and decorated her string-bikini-clad body with a smattering of logos belonging to all the mega fashion houses—a mishmash of monograms and icons where Chanel’s double Cs intermingled with Fendi’s double Fs to create a nonsense of logos. And Dapper Dan, all the way back in the late 1980s, was cutting up Gucci garment bags and transforming them into jackets in a brilliant reclamation of luxury. All this emphasis on the bag you carried spawned a growing market of counterfeit bags—and with it a new industry of authenticators. In May 2001 Vogue reported on the issue: “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, not the chicest. When you’ve dished out big bucks for the latest leather logo bag but suspect it’s a fake, who ya gonna call? David Colman meets fashion’s new crime fighters: the Authenticators.” We can thank (or point the finger at) Alexander McQueen for the low-rise trend. Though it reached its zenith in the aughts, the designer debuted tailbone-revealing bumster trousers in his 1993 Taxi Driver collection—his first collection after graduating from Central Saint Martins—and notably again in his 1995 spring-summer collection. Five or so years later, the trend had gone full-on mainstream. (In 2001 even Levi’s introduced a Superlow jean silhouette.) It was the default rise of all jeans and pants. Britney Spears was a notable proponent of the belly-baring trend. The low-rise trend also coincided with the rise of jeans for any occasion. Though it was the 1970s that gave us designer denim, brands continued to offer denim: bedazzled with diamatés, distressed to smithereens, painted with floral motifs. “Designer jeans: Can we count the ways we adore them now?” wrote Sarah Mower in Vogue’s September 2001 issue. “They’re rocking. Posing and pirouetting. Diving off into a zillion cuts, rinses, and textures, while simultaneously gate-crashing into unheard-of echelons of society. Jeans can be street, ladylike, dressed up, dressed down. They’re cool for everyday. They do black-tie. They’re fantasy and reality.” Twin forces helped to craft a new trend by the mid decade. Stateside, it was Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Retired from their teenybopper flicks (their last, New York Minute, came out in 2004), the pair was busy crafting a new, unique look that spawned dozens of copycats. Over in the UK, Sienna Miller was making waves for her take on boho: more festival chic, fewer layers. The sum of the look was greater than its parts—fashionably speaking. It was a movement more to do with styling than individual pieces: peasant dresses over puddle jeans layered with a bolero; a functionless belt (preferably perforated); and a skinny scarf spun with metallic threads for flair. In addition to the Olsens and Miller, there were Kate Moss, Mischa Barton, Nicole Richie, and other famous adopters. It’s said the force of this look, operating behind the curtain like Oz, was not a fashion designer (though Phoebe Philo did send out superfluous spaghetti-thin scarves for Chloé’s spring-summer 2005 collection) but the LA-based stylist Rachel Zoe. Though the decade was dominated by denim and It bags, there was room for a few trends born on the runway—especially for women needing something more sophisticated than denim and boho. Enter the bodycon dress. At his spring 2006 collection, Roland Mouret debuted his Galaxy dress, and without the help of TikTok or Instagram—this was pre–social media, after all—the look went viral. “You hadn’t been able to open a newspaper or magazine without seeing another young Hollywood A-lister wearing that hot-damn curvy dress: Scarlett Johansson, Cameron Diaz, Rachel Weisz, Keira Knightley, Nicole Kidman—so many, it was verging on a joke,” wrote Mower in Vogue’s October 2007 issue. “You put it on, and you looked like an icon,” added the designer. With as many colors as a book of Pantone swatches, the dress came in a double wool crepe that gripped the body like a second skin. The silhouette was below or at the knee and waist cinching, with a square neckline and sculptural cap sleeves. Like the jeans in the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, it was universally flattering. Mouret wasn’t the only designer delivering bodycon dresses. At this time, Hervé Léger (which, in April 2007, had been relaunched by Max Azria) was binding women up like metropolitan-chic mummies in his bandage dresses. No red carpet was complete without at least one bandage dress. In the aughts, magazines (and tabloids) were still the predominant form of fashion news, along with budding blogs and news websites. All of these were filled with snaps of celebs circulating in the starry constellations of Hollywood. Paris Hilton and her Simple Life costar Nicole Richie were frequent tabloid fodder; so too were Britney Spears, Cameron Diaz, Lindsey Lohan, and newcomer on the block Kim Kardashian. These off-duty looks produced head-scratching trends adopted by the masses: Juicy Couture velour tracksuits with script on the derrieres, ragged-edge miniskirts paired with Ugg boots, and baby tees emblazoned with words like angel. Page-boy caps, It bags, and a Starbucks Frappuccino finished off the look. Chloé, Hervé Léger, Roland Mouret, Balenciaga, Burberry, Yves Saint Laurent, Juicy Couture, Marc Jacobs, Versace, Prada, Miu Miu, Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Calvin Klein, Fendi, Tom Ford, Gucci, Martin Margiela, Dries Van Noten, Vivienne Westwood, Comme des Garçons’ Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto, John Galliano, Chanel, Oscar de la Renta, Kenzo, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Michael Kors, Moschino, Alaïa, Lanvin, Roberto Cavalli, Stella McCartney, Viktor & Rolf, Pucci, Gareth Pugh, Christopher Kane, Rodarte, Phillip Lim, Jason Wu, Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin, Nina Ricci, Raf Simmons, Isabel Toledo The top of the decade was dominated by the stage looks of boy bands: frosted trips and leather jackets with a metallic sheen. For teenagers, Abercrombie & Fitch’s elitist Americana prep ruled; the more polos the better. Hip-hop and the styles worn in music videos on MTV were chock-full of fashion like Air Jordans, iced-out chains, and baggy jerseys. By the mid decade, a new look was taking hold thanks to the runways of Dior Homme, which appointed Tunisian-Italian designer Hedi Slimane as creative director. For Dior, Slimane churned out ultra-skinny pants, ties, and jackets inspired by rockers with waifish frames like Pete Doherty. If Kate Moss’s arrival in the 1990s signaled the heroine-chic era for women, Slimane passed the baton onto menswear in the 2000s. It was a look that carried over into the early 2010s and has since been dubbed indie sleaze. A crop of garage rock and post-punk bands (The Strokes, The Killers, The Libertines) epitomized the look. For men who didn’t dabble in the mall-based or music-video-inspired trends of the aughts, the tailoring of Giorgio Armani remained the height of fashion. The decade started off with the 9/11 terrorist attack, which left the world reeling. It ended on an optimistic note with the arrival of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States. And when his wife Michelle Obama stepped out at the inauguration gala in a white Jason Wu dress, she launched the young designer into the spotlight. In 2001 Apple changed the game with the introduction of the iPod, and then six years later, on June 29, 2007, Apple released its first-generation iPhone, making a leap in technology with the first smartphone. The decade also saw the rise of reality TV: Survivor aired in 2000, America’s Next Top Model in 2003, and Keeping Up With the Kardashians arrived in 2007. The first Harry Potter film arrived in 2001, Twitter launched in 2006, and that same year the world got its first Taylor Swift album. In 2007 the first episode of Gossip Girl aired, and Beyoncé and Jay-Z tied the knot in 2008.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. First came 1989’s Black Friday stock market crash, then came the recession of 1990. The economic downturn? In fashion, it resulted in an abrupt halt of that more-is-more, greed-is-good ’80s opulence. Fashion felt like sobering up, and designers delivered a new minimalist look that was received like a breath of fresh air that swept people off their feet—enter Calvin Klein, Jil Sander, and Helmut Lang. (In 1990, Ribat Ozbek showed an all-white collection that marked the turning point and a reset of the times.) The decade started off with leggy, Versace-clad supermodels (Linda! Cindy! Naomi! Christy!) ruling the scene with their heady allure. The look was sexy, 24/7. A few years in, though, the tides turned and Vogue called out a return of the gamine—but these weren’t your wide-eyed ingenues of the 1960s. What followed was a crop of waifish models with a pallor, who gave the appearance of possessing bird-like hollow bones, and unlike their formidable predecessors, looked as though (in the words of Karl Lagerfeld) “they need protection.” The epitome of this new muse? Kate Moss. The decade raced ahead with angst surrounding the coming of Y2K with trepidation in newfangled tech (flip phones and the internet), manifesting two new fashion aesthetics. One was fiercely fantastical—fashion that escaped the present and mish-mashed elements from far-flung cultures and previous eras together. The other was a theatrical pastiched potpourri of fashion references that looked back, yes, but also left, right, and front and center (see John Galliano for Dior.) The other style born out of the Y2k era was an embrace of the change, a playful take on cyber fashion. This look was championed by Jean Paul Gaultier with his the-future-is-now creations. A look back at the trends that defined ’90s fashion, below. They were turning heads and fluttering hearts in the late 1980s, but with the arrival of the ’90s, they had the world officially enraptured. They were the supermodels. The big four? Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, and Christy Turlington. But then there was Claudia Schiffer, Tatjana Patitz, Tyra Banks, Carla Bruni Sarkozy, Helena Christensen, Yasmeen Ghauri, Nadja Auermann, Stephanie Seymour, Elle MacPherson, and more. “Why are these girls so famous? Why are they personalities in their own right? Why are they known from one side of the globe to the other? How come I can turn on the TV in Scotland and watch Christy Turlington washing her little face with three kinds of Camay soap? How come a Japanese news crew flies to Paris to ask Linda Evangelista—in English— what her hobbies are? (Playing the accordion.) How come these girls are paid so much? Photographed so much? In such demand? Where has the extraordinary phenomenon of the supermodel come from?” asked Vicki Woods in a jaunty article in Vogue’s July 1991 issue. They walked runways; when Evangelista, Turlington, Campbell, and Crawford, sashayed down Gianni Versace’s fall 1991 runway show arm in arm, it was said they were far more famous than the clothes. They had famous boyfriends; Crawford, at the time, was married to Richard Gere. They lent their faces (per Woods, “as full of bones as a fifties corset, though not bony”) to the biggest brands; see Crawford’s sultry Pepsi commercial, and Turlington’s Calvin Klein Eternity ads. They embodied the woman of the 1990s—liberated, powerful in their own skin. Never before in history had fashion models yielded such influence. They were household names and fashion brands clamored to work with them. The rise of the supermodel coincided with the rise of individuality in fashion; mute mannequins were out. Models with passions, personalities, and pizazz were in. By the mid-decade, a new crop of models emerged. Like younger sisters to their grown-up predecessors, these new models were less bodacious glamazons and more waifish willows. And they seemed tailor-made to represent a subculture of fashion that would soon trickle up onto the runway: grunge. These models? Kate Moss, Shalom Harlow, Kirsty Hume, Stella Tennant, and Amber Valletta. In a March 1996 article IDing the new gaggles of supers called “Supermodels: The Sequel,” Karl Lagerfeld speaks to this generation of models. “They are very young, very much like children—what’s referred to like an elf. There is a kind of vulnerability about them. They need protection…But not Stella Tennant, eh? Because she is a tough number.” Seattle gave the world a whole new sound in the 1990s and the world listened. The worn-in thrifted fashions (flannel shirts over vintage tees, baggy aged jeans, sneakers, day-old hair) worn by bands Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam were less shocking than the Punk fashions of the 1970s and, therefore, more widely adopted. The look wasn’t effortless per se, but it was not the intent to look as though you had put in any effort. Fashion as secondary was the intent; musings on the human condition and introspection were paramount to grunge. By the 1990s, the “grunge” look had infiltrated the wardrobes of teenagers the world over, and eventually, it made its way onto the catwalk in a then-rare trickle-up progression. Famously, Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis’ spring/summer 1993 collection was inspired by the laid-back look. The collection which went down in fashion history but unfortunately gave Jacobs the boot at Perry Ellis (he was ahead of his time!) was shown in September of 1992. That December, Steven Meisel photographed Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a memorable spread “Grunge & Glory.” The text that accompanied the spread, by Jonathan Poneman, was as follows. “Throw out your detergent! This is not a call to arms; it’s an invitation to dress down and party up! As the fin de siècle draws near, greed has gone to seed. What started out as a serfs’ rebellion against aristocratic glamour has turned into a fashion revolution that champions “revolting” for its own sake.” In the spread, edited by Grace Coddington, models wore Ralph Lauren, Anna Sui, and plaid shirting with the sleeves hacked off over translucent Calvin Klein slip dresses. There are lots of beanies, layering, and band tees. The following year, in Suzy Menkes’ review of Jacobs’ show in Vogue’s January 1993 issue: “I told Marc Jacobs that his Perry Ellis show—all floppy coats worn with crochet vests and hot pants or ombre chiffon tunics and pajamas—looked like hippies with attitude. ‘I don’t like labels. It’s how you wear clothes today. It’s how the girls look when they come in here,’ he said. How grunge is that?” “Just as the Bauhaus dedicated itself to the relentless pursuit of pure form, today’s minimalists—from Jil Sander to Calvin Klein—aim for the same goal. Fashion embraces the new uniform,” Vogue wrote in May of 1996, opening a Steven Meisel-photographed editorial featuring Stella Tennant. Never before had fashion been so un-fussy. Designers like Calvin Klein, Helmut Lang, and Prada jumped on the momentum of a pendulum swinging away from the extreme opulence and exaggeration of 1980s fashion. For those minimalists in the 1990s, fashion in its purest form was prized. Slip dresses without seams, button-ups with a utilitarian straight-forwardness, a color palette of blacks, whites, navy, and, if feeling peppy, pastels in the shades of Jordan almonds. Rarely a pattern; never an embellishment. The look was almost virginal, as though untouched by fashion. As the decade inched closer to Y2K, ’90s fashion got nostalgic. Designers were referencing sleeves from the 1880s, with bias cuts from the 1930s, and the couture craftsmanship of the 1950s. On top of this medley of eras, various sartorial inspirations from throughout the globe were sprinkled in. Native dress and folkloric fashions from everywhere and anywhere were pulled from. A champion of this look was John Galliano, who launched his own label in 1986. By 1995, he was designing for Givenchy but it wasn’t until he landed at Dior in 1997 that Galliano’s fashion fantasy really took flight. Alexander McQueen, meanwhile, who had launched his label in 1992, fused fashion history with natural history with a cabinet of curiosities-approach to dressing women. Rifat Ozbek, whose much-lauded all-white collection in 1990 references Western headdresses, epitomized the fantasy look. So did Vivienne Westwood, who continued to celebrate all things Victoriana in her Anglomania lines, Dries Van Noten, who skillfully assembles prints and patterns, and Jean Paul Gaultier, with his spring/summer 1994 ‘Les Tatouages’ tattoo collection. The arrival of the internet and digital photography influenced fashion in a playful way. While technology in fashion did play out with advancements in fiber technology, with the introduction of micro-modal fabrics and silicon-coated fibers in athletic wear, fashion had fun with the concept of the World Wide Web. “With the coming millennium in mind, designers put their own spin on cyberstyle with visionary high-tech- meets-primitive mixes,” wrote Vogue in the March 1994 issue. While advancements of technology weren’t really required for the look, it was futuristic. Thierry Mugler, who looked ahead with his sexed-up cyborgs robot collection in fall/winter 1995 collection. Rifat Ozbek sent out a calculator necklace that was suspended in tribal-looking beads in the ultimate post-apocalyptic chic accessory. Hussein Chalayan sent out several collections that championed this brand-new aesthetic. And Jil Sander designed dresses fashion after space age 2.0-looking aluminum foil sheaths. On screen, there was 1997’s The Fifth Element which featured Milla Jovovich costumed by Jean Paul Gaultier, and 1999’s The Matrix adding to the drama of the cyber age’s fashionable manifestations. In 1991, TLC came onto the scene and delivered a fresh new look. At the beginning of the decade, TLC continued the 1980s hip-hop style with bright neons, parachute pants, and oversized denim dungarees, which they safely pinned condoms onto for safe sex promotion. Given that they were riffing off male rappers’ fashion, the look was tomboyish. As the group matured, they began dressing in body-bearing looks, like metallic sports bras with cargo pants and slinky leotards. In 1996, Aaliyah was chosen for Tommy Hilfiger’s Tommy Jeans ad campaign, sporting a tube top and exposed Tommy Hilfiger-branded underwear band and baggy, particolored pants. By 1998, Destiny’s Child was formed and would soon set trends. In 1997, Kimora Lee Simmons launched Baby Phat, which sold the hip hip lifestyle to anyone who wanted to look the part. Though a designer licensing their name was nothing new (Halston exercised nearly all possibilities in the 1970s), the 1990s saw licenses and diffusion labels galore. There was Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Label, Lauren By Ralph Lauren etc, Calvin Klein underwear, sheets, and fragrances, DKNY by Donna Karan, Giorgio Armani launched Emporio Armani, Dolce and Gabbana launched D&G, and Versace launched Versus and in 1989, their couture collection Atelier Versace was born—proof that no one could get enough Versace! Elsewhere, fashion houses were being revived and sustained with a clever placement of fashion designers; Tom Ford arrived at Gucci in 2000 and the world was never the same. Marc Jacobs was appointed as creative director at Louis Vuitton in 1998 and designed the house’s first-ever ready-to-wear collection that same year, and Miuccia Prada’s ready-to-wear collections (launched in 1988) for her family’s storied leather goods label ushered in a whole new era for Prada.

At offices, Casual Fridays were quickly taking over and companies like the Gap cashed in, dressing men in Chinos instead of woolen trousers. Elsewhere, the hip-hop and grunge music scenes were a couple of fashion tribes men could join. In the former, baggy jeans with baggy, layered tees ruled. In the latter, thrifted band tees paired beneath unbuttoned button-ups and ripped jeans were favored. Men could also partake in the cyber-fashion trend with spiked frosted blond tips and metallic goggle-like sunglasses. On TV, Friends premiered in 1994, and Jennifer Aniston became an overnight fashion muse for the masses. Men were inspired by The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’s and the zany fashions worn by Will Smith. On the bigger screen, Clueless became an instant fashion classic, introducing a whole new generation to the importance of Alaïa. Boy and girl bands ruled—N’Sync, The Backstreet Boys, The Spice Girls, Destiny’s Child. Technology became an integral part of life; the first-ever flip phone from Motorola was released in 1996. Google was founded in September of 1998. Bill Clinton became president of the United States in 1993 and in 1998 he was impeached. In 1995, O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. In 1997, Princess Diana tragically passed away in a car accident in Paris.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. The fuel of the 1980s? Power. It came in many forms: a healthy stock portfolio, a fit physique, a shattered glass ceiling. The decade stomped ahead to the beat of the NYSE bell, the music of MTV, and the click-clacks of keyboards on personal computers. And 1980s fashion was just as novel—Lycra clung to bodies revealing curves like never before and the power suit was born. A particularly evocative editorial from Vogue’s October 1985 issue summed up the moment perfectly. Photographed by Helmut Newton, the spread, entitled “Power Dressing,” featured women hovering above men—who were filling their gas tanks, cleaning their pools, and trimming their hedges. The accompanying text was as follows: “A different way of looking at fashion—as entertainment, as fantasy, as a provocative element. And men looking differently at women. Women at men. The women dressing to be noticed…and gain the upper hand. Men can fuel fantasy. But women set the direction…and the tone. You get the sense that things are changing.” By the 1980s, the previous decades’ pliable polyester suits were quickly replaced with more structured, angular versions that sent a message— women wanted power, and they were dressing the part. The work done by the 1970s Women’s Liberation Movement (notably the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974) had leveled the playing field, especially when it came to finances. The economy was booming and women wanted in. Responding to the times, designers like Claude Montana, Emanuel Ungaro, Theirry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Yves Saint Laurent crafted suits and skirt suits that wore like armor—shoulders were exaggerated and padded, double-breasted silhouettes made a figure loom larger than it was, and peplums made the wearer even more imposing. That isn’t to say the look was androgynous; beadwork, fabrication, and bold colors differentiated the look from traditional men’s suits. Power suits didn’t whisper femininity, they roared it. A term that no one can properly attribute, yuppie—an acronym standing for “young urban professional” or “young upwardly-mobile professional”— was notably used in a 1980 article in Chicago magazine. The label was divisive almost immediately; some resonated with the moniker, while others saw it as a marker of pretentiousness and bland taste. And at its worst, the yuppie signified thoughtless gentrification in the name of capitalism. By the end of the decade, Vogue made its stance clear in an article in 1989: “The horrifying little yuppie suit (which, with its copycat male pinstripes and flop-doodle little-girl bow tie, did more for making women look stuffy and drab than, as intended, male and \"powerful”) is now, thank the gods of Seventh Avenue, on the endangered species list.” Nonetheless (and whether fashion liked it or not), the look had a chokehold on the 1980s. 1984’s tongue-in-cheek The Yuppie Handbook outlined it all—for women, Ralph Lauren skirt suits, a pussy-bow blouse, a Coach bag, and running shoes instead of pumps. For men, a pinstriped three-piece suit, a Rolex, a Burberry trench, and a squash racquet. Essentially, a combination of “timeless” closet staples. Another take on the Yuppie look (and one more celebrated by Vogue) was crafted by Ralph Lauren, who took the collegiate-Americana look to the next level by mining quintessentially American fashions from the Southwest and fusing them with the traditions of the English gentry. If the yuppie look lacked imagination, the preppy Ralph Lauren look was fueled by fantasy—and polo shirts. “Hotter than hot. Narrower than narrow. More body-conscious than any body could be. Designer Azzedine Alaïa, the newest name on the fashion horizon…has already captured the imagination of French fashion watchers. And now, he’s wooing Americans…with clothes that underscore the natural beauty, the natural drama of the body,” wrote in Vogue’s December 1982 issue. Alaïa, who was dubbed the King of Cling with his Lycra-infused body sculpting dresses, was heavily inspired by athleticwear; his pieces featured ribbed crew-necks and cuffs and racerbacks sleeves. The look was hot-hot and Alaïa wasn’t the only designer capitalizing on the body-con. Donna Karan, who launched her own label in 1984 after making a name for herself designing for Anne Klein, was also wrapping women in cling-wrap-like dresses. Meanwhile, Norma Kamali was also borrowing from gymwear; her Sweats collection in 1981 fashioned French terry into gathered midi skirts, elegant raglan-sleeved sweater dresses, and capes. Over in Italy, the body was being celebrated by Gianni Versace, who was just getting started with his fashion vision. With a booming economy and new wealth creation in the Middle East, couture had a new wind in the 1980s. Saint Laurent was still holding court at his label, Karl Lagerfeld was appointed to revive the house of Chanel in 1983, and newcomers to the couture scene ensured couture continued to dominant the machinations of the fashion system—Christian Lacroix (his tutu-inspired skirts for fall-winter 1988 were much-talked-about), Emanuel Ungaro, and Gianfranco Ferré. Lagerfeld’s impact on Chanel was immediate—it took all but one season. Vogue’s June 1983 issue writes, “Suddenly, everyone is talking about Chanel. One of the reasons—Karl Lagerfeld, now the designer for Chanel Couture.” Commingling with the decade’s power suits and body-con dresses was a whole new genre of fashion emanating out of London. Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren reinvented themselves from Punk to New Romantic. Their highly-lauded 1981 “Pirate” collection, which was a flamboyant, unisex collection that riffed on the 19th-century dandy, set the tone; it featured blousy, ruffled shirting in squiggly prints and tricorn hats. The collection seemed to kick-start a look (a melding of Punk’s bricolage styling and Glam Rock effeminacy) that was embraced by London’s club kids with open arms—think Boy George and the theatrical Leigh Bowery. A few years later, in 1984 came John Galliano’s fashion-history-making senior thesis collection for Central Saint Martins, dubbed “Les Incroyables,” which was inspired by the fashion of revolutionary France. With a cockade-inspired color palette and a layering of waistcoats over blouses over light-colored breeches, the collection captured a moment in time and catapulted Galliano onto the global fashion stage. Other designers pushing out the New Romantics look were Rifat Ozbek, Martin Kidman, and Stephen Jones. The 1980s saw the continued celebration of Issey Miyake, Comme des Garçons’ Rei Kawakubo, and Yohji Yamamoto. Each designer had a unique point of view but shared a methodology that flipped fashion on its head. Concept was key, technology was employed, and convention went out the window. Though Miyake launched his line in 1970, Comme de Garçons was founded in 1969, and Yohji Yamamoto in 1972, by the 1980s, this crop of designers had conquered Paris. Standout moments include Issey Miyake’s red plastic bustier, the finale of his fall 1980-81 collection; Jean-Michel Basquiat walking the Comme des Garçons Homme Plus spring 1987 show in a tunic-length double-breasted jacket; and Yohji Yamamoto’s red-tulle bustle coat for fall-winter 1986-87. The idea was to provoke thought—not sex, and Vogue had its thoughts in September’s 1983 issue. “This year’s clothes from Japan and their offspring—often dark, intentionally droopy, oversized— inevitably inspire conversation. Some of it is rabidly for, some heatedly against. People are saying, at various times: Japanese clothes are a fluke, an influence, an evolution; a new way of looking at layering, deep coloring, natural fabrics, big shapes. But are they affecting what we\\'ll be wearing?...[they] are going to ease into the mainstream, and we won’t even recognize them. Then evolve—as all clothes do—into memory.” A fitness craze took over in the 1980s. A range of Vogue headlines from the decades spoke to the public’s curiosity and fascination with health: 1982’s “Exercise: How to Start,” 1988’s “Should Pregnant Women Exercise?,” 1985’s “How Female Execs Exercise,” and 1988’s “No Sweat Exercise?” Meanwhile, clothing labels were pumping out clothing made for working out (Lycra body suits were worn over leggings in punchy colors and were accessorized with leg warmers and sweatbands) and celebrities started cashing in with workout videos. Released in 1982, Jane Fonda’s workout video became one of the best-selling VHS tapes of all time. Vivienne Westwood, Comme des Garçons’ Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto, Donna Karan, John Galliano, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Claude Montana, Emanuel Ungaro, Thierry Mugler, Christian Lacroix, Jean Paul Gaultier, Emanuel Ungaro, Geoffrey Beene, Ralph Lauren, Bill Blass, Stephen Burrows, Oscar de la Renta, Anne Klein, Sonia Rykiel, Missoni, Chloé, Kenzo, Issey Miyake, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Betsey Johnson, Mary McFadden, Marc Bohan for Christian Dior, Zandra Rhodes, Bob Mackie, Perry Ellis, Giorgia Armani, Patrick Kelly Though decadent for women, 1980s fashion for men was far more sober. The disco swagger of the 1970s was quickly phased out as fashion fell for classic tailoring. Giorgio Armani’s wardrobe for Richard Gere in 1980’s American Gigolo had men clamoring to de-flare their pants and shrink their once oversize collars. The look was sleek. For these men, fashion was dictated not by Seventh Avenue but Wall Street. But men could dabble in a variety of trends, which often mirrored female fashion (or vice versa). Men’s power suiting was typically pinstriped and double-breasted with wide lapels and ties. They could embrace yuppie-prep in khaki pants and collegiate knitwear. The 1980s saw the rise of hip-hop; the genre not only burst onto the scene, it redefined it. Hip-hop wasn’t just a musical style, it was a movement with its own look—Harlem’s Dapper Dan was outfitting LL Cool J, The Fat Boys, Jam Master Jay and Big Daddy Kane, and more. Kangol bucket caps, gold chains, acid-wash jeans, and jogging suits (Run DMC was partial to Adidas tracksuits) became hallmarks of the hip-hop style that would evolve and influence fashion as the decade progressed. In 1981, Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles in an extravagant wedding dress with leg-of-mutton sleeves designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel. The dress defined wedding dress styles for the next decade, but beyond that, Princess Diana’s style—every look, every sartorial choice, even the arrangement of the hair on her head—was highly noted and copied. That same year, MTV arrived on the scene and music was consumed in a whole new way. Madonna became a music icon and a fashion icon with her thrifted eclecticism in the 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan. Meanwhile, teen culture boomed with just-for-them flicks like The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink.

Following her surprise appearance at Trooping the Colour in June, Kate Middleton took her seat in the Royal Box at Wimbledon today to watch Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz face off in the Gentlemen’s Singles Final. In a break from her usual SW19 style, the Princess of Wales wore a custom version of Safiyaa’s Cecilia dress in Wimbledon purple for her turn on Centre Court. Joining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch the match? Both Pippa Middleton and Princess Charlotte, who has reportedly been “really taking care of her mum” throughout her treatment. Kate has, of course, been a fixture in SW19 since joining the royal family 13 years ago, becoming Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2016. Not only is she one of the tournament’s most animated spectators, she’s also taken part in ball girl training with Roger Federer, and—following Emma Raducanu’s Grand Slam win in 2021—even had a lesson with the former British No 1 at the National Tennis Centre. Princess Charlotte wore polka dots for the outing, a favorite print of her mother’s. Still, there was doubt about whether Kate would be able to attend this year’s event. In an update on her health in June, the Princess wrote that, while she was “looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade,” she was “not out of the woods yet” when it came to her cancer treatment. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days, you feel weak, tired, and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” As for the Prince of Wales? As President of the Football Association, William traveled to Germany on Sunday to watch the Euros finals at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. And he isn’t the only Windsor who will be gripped by the match. “My wife and I join all our family in wishing you the warmest congratulations on reaching the final of the UEFA European Championship—and in sending our very best wishes for Sunday’s match,” the King wrote in a message to the England team after they defeated the Netherlands on Wednesday. “If I may encourage you to secure victory before the need for any last-minute wonder-goals or another penalties drama, I am sure the stresses on the nation’s collective heart rate and blood pressure would be greatly alleviated!” Meghan Markle Is Returning to Television Kate Middleton and Prince William Share a Never-Before-Seen Wedding Picture The Royal Family Have Been Lifestyle Influencers for Centuries The Greatest Royal Tiaras in History Are We Entering a New Era of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?

Long before method dressing had mobilized on the red carpets, sports fans were attending sports tournaments dressed in the image of their sporting idols. So much so, in fact, that there is now a common misconception that Wimbledon spectators must subscribe to the same all-white dress code–established in the prudish 1800s to mask sweat stains–that applies only to those playing on court. Few people have taken this tradition quite as literally as Jennifer Lawrence who–despite being some 3,471 miles away from the stadium–was yesterday afternoon photographed strolling through Manhattan in head-to-toe Wimbledon whites: a starchy button-down and cotton tennis shorts from The Row with New Balance X Aimé Leon Dore sneakers and ankle-length Ralph Lauren socks. Lawrence was not–but looked as though she could have been–among the rest of the A-listers at this year’s grand slam. There is, I think, little difference between wearing colorless fashions at Wimbledon and wearing cowboy hats at a music festival or wearing friendship bracelets at a Taylor Swift concert. These dress codes–however unofficial–harness the collective and provide people with a sense of belonging. How sweet it has been, for example, to see thousands of emotionally illiterate men at the 2024 Euros dressed as the objects of their affection in matching team uniforms. Jennifer Lawrence should join Adele at this Sunday’s final.

              " 'Find anything you save across the site in your account  We’re now entering the dog days of summer, and between the unrelenting heat and the quiet period before spring 2025 fashion shows begin, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern. But this week, celebrities broke through the humid haze, and reminded us that premieres, sports games, and awards shows are about having fun with fashion. Heat be damned, it was a big week for leather. In Los Angeles, MaXXXine star Mia Goth wore a skintight Versace number with a built-in bustier detail, while fellow scream queen Maika Monroe hit the premiere of her new film, Longlegs, in an ab-baring black leather bra and skirt set from Courrèges. Meanwhile, across the pond, Emma Corrin also brought leather to premiere dressing, donning a jacket and corset made from leather belts, courtesy of Schiaparelli couture. Not everybody opted for BDSM-inspired dressing, though. At the ESPY Awards, Serena Williams glimmered in a scaly red Ferragamo dress. Elsewhere, Daisy Edgar-Jones put the wind to work for her (and her chocolate Vivienne Westwood dress) at the European premiere of Twisters. Beyond the red carpet glamour, the stars still showed us top-tier outfits. Margot Robbie formally debuted her maternity style at Wimbledon, kicking things off with a fresh-off-the-runway Alaïa look, complete with snap details that mimicked polka-dots. So, are you more partial to something casual like Bella Hadid’s vintage Tom Ford-era Gucci pants, or something bridal-inspired, like Meghan Markle’s Oscar de la Renta? Below, vote on your favorite celebrity look, and check back on Friday to see who Vogue readers crowned best dressed of the week!

              " 'Find anything you save across the site in your account  Glastonbury is over for another year, and attention now turns to Wimbledon, where the style mood is less Barbour jackets, slogan tees and short shorts, more polite heels and summer tailoring. Wimbledon fans may well be deprived of their usual Princess of Wales sighting this year, given that the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club has temporarily stepped away from her public engagements as she continues to focus on her health, but the tournament is already delivering on spectator style. David Beckham kicked things off in a custom Boss suit, while former world number one Maria Sharapova wore Burberry to take in the first day of the tournament. The following day, Grace Jones popped up in the stands wearing a flying helmet and aviator shades, strawberry in one hand, plastic wine glass in the other (once an icon…). Wednesday, meanwhile, brought an appearance from small-screen royalty in the shape of Kim Cattrall, who arrived at the All England Club in pink suiting and shades as her former Sex and the City co-stars are busy filming for season three of And Just Like That. During the second week of Wimbledon, stars including Jodie Turner-Smith, Ncuti Gatwa and Yasmin Finney turned out for our friends’ at British Vogue’s annual lunch with Ralph Lauren. Meanwhile, there were actual royal sightings in the form of Queen Camilla and Princess Beatrice, while Sienna Miller, Alexa Chung and Keira Knightley all gave their takes on the Wimbledon dress code.

Since 2022, adidas has established itself as the most prolific sneaker brand among the street style set—and it\\'s all thanks to some master collaborations. The Wales Bonner collab was an unprecedented success, especially when the designer revisited the Samba, the most popular style of all. However, some celebrities have been opting for less sought-after pairs. Such is the case for Bella Hadid. Spotted in the streets of New York, the model attended an adidas event wearing a signature red jersey and a pair of rarely-seen sneakers. Enter the SL 72 OG, which are about to dethrone the Samba. As their name suggests, these \"Super Light\" silhouettes were first launched in 1972 to equip athletes at the Munich Olympic Games. They revolutionized running and were intended to be worn between competitions. Bella Hadid Earlier this year, Hadid was spotted wearing another pair, which she styled with an aged-effect brown leather jacket worn over a tank top, as well as vintage Levi\\'s with a brown belt and gold buckle. Bella Hadid Thanks in part to Bella Hadid, all signs are pointing to a SL 72 OG comeback in 2024.

Super Bowl Halftime show? Pregnancy reveal. In short, when the world zigs, Rihanna zags. Last night proved no exception to her rule-breaking tendencies: Rih took a stroll through New York with her partner A$AP Rocky, where she rocked a two-piece zebra-printed set. In case you missed it, a leopard print revival has been brewing for some time now, with everyone from Kendall Jenner and Irina Shayk, to Maya Hawke and Dua Lipa taking the trend for a spin. (And don’t forget about the Wales Bonner Sambas that have everybody and their mother in a chokehold.) But Rihanna is going to do her own thing no matter what, and if that means wearing a zebra stripes in place of leopard spots, then so be it! Rih paired the gauzy button-up and pants set with playful accessories. She threw a black patent leather bag over her shoulder and wore a pair of silver metallic ballet flats—perfect for a jaunt around the streets of SoHo—which she contrasted with a New York Yankees baseball cap. Maybe, to Rihanna, zebra is to leopard print what the Yankees are to the Mets? So whether that means you’re going to toss out your leopard print and buy a Yankees hat, that’s all you, but Rihanna will keep doing her own thing, regardless.

              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account   Released on 07/11/2024 [upbeat music] Hello there. My name is Jose Criales-Unzueta and I'm a fashion writer at Vogue Runway. I'm here this week in Paris to go to the haute couture collections, and today I'm gonna take you with me to an exclusive Vogue preview of Thom Browne's second couture collection in Paris. [gentle music] We've asked Thom why is it that he likes to create haute couture and why it has become important for an American designer to show a couture collection in Paris. [gentle music] We're here at Thom Browne. This is his Paris office, so let's see what he has in store for us this season. Hello. [classical music] Hi Thom. Good to see you. Good to see you. Thanks for having us. Thanks for coming. [Jose] Everything's coming together. [classical music] [classical music continues] Hello. [Thom] I wanted this show to be like a good play on the beauty of just making really well-made clothes. [Jose] I remember the first time we spoke, like ahead of your first show, you told me how excited you were about bringing this idea of American craftsmanship and couture into Paris, but also merging those worlds. What made you come back to couture this year? [Thom] The initial concept was really to work with the craftsmanship of tailoring and work with the actual muslins as the final garments. [Jose] Yes. And I thought, compared to the last couture show last July where everything was beautifully finished and embroidered, I wanted to do the polar opposite and really use the muslins and the craft of making clothes as the couture element. And this is where it all starts. [Jose] Right. Everything that you see in any one of our shows starts with a muslin, and then it goes into what the fabrication will be, or what the embroidery will be. But there's so much that goes into each piece, and you'll see the idea of muslin being carried throughout the collection. And then there is the overall theme of we're in Paris, and the Olympics coming. Here are the gold, silver, and bronze medals. At the end of the show, it's beating, it's bullion, so it's an entirely medal jacket. Couture is like fashion's ultimate sport. [Jose] It is. It is. Yes. [classical music] So I guess we can focus on this one since we're gonna look at this book. Yeah. It's one of the more finished pieces and it really just, it encapsulates the real essence of the entire show. The strength in the tailoring you'll see in the shoulder and the sleeve, but then also, too, the idea of it being partially finished, [Thom] Right. It's basically the work-in-progress version of what the finished piece would be. I think it's really one of the most- [Jose] It's really remarkable. [Thom] Timeless, beautiful pieces, with the jacket and the skirt. The artwork is a conceptualized, Grecian, Olympian figure mixed with filigree and laurel leaves. It took close to 11,000 hours. [Jose] Okay. And 42 craftsmen sitting around a table. And the dimension of the embroidery is something I think is really special too. [gentle music] And of course, Dory looks so good in it. Yeah, I mean, this is... It's just so good looking. It's just remarkable. [Thom] And kind of like what I was saying, the shape is so simple, but I always just reference the tailoring of the shoulder and the sleeve is so sharp. And then Hector with his gold medal. [Jose] With his little gold medal. So cute. [Thom] You know, you could finish the whole thing. [Jose] Yeah, they could. But it's kind of perfect unfinished, you know? [gentle music] Yeah, then next to you too is almost like the idea of half of it being finished and the other half just in the muslin version of what the embroidery would be. So this really encapsulates the idea of the show too. But even seeing the basting stitches here is all hand done. This is really wild. Yeah. I mean, even down to the nipples or like that, just that attention to detail. [Thom] You touched it. You just touched it. I know, I'm sorry. [chuckling] [gentle music] [Thom] I always say the quality of what I do, I think, is the most fashionable thing. I like to showcase, especially being an American designer, that this quality is done in New York and it's beautiful to be here in something that is so cultural here in Paris, and to represent American fashion that way. [gentle music] I love the experience to be all immersive. And I like everybody to feel like they're part of the experience. So everyone coming to shows will get this. Will get this? This is the invitation. Oh my God, I love this. Oh, this is sick. [Man] It actually looks really good. It does. I can't wait to see the whole room with everybody in there. This is gonna, yeah, the whole room is gonna be crazy. Especially with your shows, people are always looking for the way in, in a way, to just sort of participate in the world you've built. So I think handing them the opportunity is really exciting. [upbeat music] Thank you so much for your time. [Thom] Thank you. [upbeat music] [upbeat music continues] [audience applause] [Jose] I've just the Thom Browne show. As you can tell, I am wearing my show invite. I had a great time. As always with Thom, it was quite a spectacle. It was lovely to see some New York-made, American haute couture in Paris. I am Jose Criales-Unzueta. I am signing off for Vogue and I'll see you next time. [upbeat music] [upbeat music fades out] More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account   Released on 07/01/2024 [Commentator 1] That's one of Jamaican, one of Jamaican [indistinct] [upbeat music] [Commentator 2] Good- Oh wow! [Commentator 2] Oh, look out. She means business. [upbeat techno music] [Sha'Carri] I feel like fashion is the flow of the body. Fashion is the flow of expression. Fashion relates to the way that I move my body. The way that I run down the track is almost like the same way I could strut down the runway. Fashion and sports are one in the same expression of self and expression of flow. [upbeat techno music] Beauty and the Beast comes together. Basically, this is my own catwalk. My lane is my catwalk. [upbeat techno music] [crickets chirping] It seems like a lot of athletes move here. I don't know if it's the weather. I don't know if it's like the coaches that are here, but this seems like the place to be for athletes. [laughs] [gentle music] I just think it's important that she is in the environment that she trains in to honor how she expresses herself. [Speaker] What? [people laughing] [people chattering] Key gives me an energy that even while she's doing my hair, I can almost like feel her genuineness going into my scalp. Just her coming in with different ideas, I'm like, I'm with it. Like, let's do it. Like what else you wanna do? I only could get to this point through experience and having the right people around me. I know that no matter what I do, no matter what decision I made, I know that it comes from me. [upbeat music] [Announcer] This could be her moment. This should be her moment. [upbeat techno music] [gun firing] [Interviewer] Where'd you get the idea for that? My head. [all laughing] 'Cause I was like, I don't know, she didn't like her hair. Why does she still have the wig on? And I see her rip it. I was like, Oh my God. Yes, ma'am. I know that's right. And I understood the symbolism when she did it. Like I understand where she was coming from. I'm not gonna change the confidence that I have in myself ever, but at the same time I have learned that there's a way that I can carry that so much more gracefully. That's what really that moment came from. I actually grind some nails because of my grandmother. She could grow her natural nails out this long and I'm not even over exaggerating it. That was something I noticed it when I was younger, just always stuck with me. These are like more acrylic, but that's fine. [laughs] [Announcer] Last year's women's hundred meters winner, the American Florence Griffith Joiner. Seeing Flo-Jo, her style as well as Gail, just showing their different approaches, how they come to the line. The blue, the white, the red, the gold. She did her thing. Oh my God. Wait, what's the five for? [Sha'Carri] The lane. Five is my favorite lane. And then lane nine, which is a historical lane setting a championship record. [Commentator] Sha'Carri's done it! That was the inspiration behind the nails. [Announcer] Their queen of the track, Florence Griffith Joiner is here and the fastest woman on earth with the Hollywood style. I more so found my interest in Flo-Jo after the fact of finding my love for track through my mom. It hurt me, but it didn't bother me. I know that I'm a champion. Flo-Jo's influence on me definitely comes from her creativity and it her freedom to just express herself in a way that no other female athlete honestly had ever done. Showing beauty, yet being able to show hard work, applying to each other. There are a lot of parallels between Flo-Jo and Sha'Carri. They both have a very distinct style, like very independent, strong women. They like to show themselves on the track. [bright music] [Sha'Carri] I wanna make sure that my makeup doesn't look lighter than what I am. I'm a melanin girl, so I wanna make sure that it match my skin tone. [Sally] I'm gonna work with you. [Sha'Carri] Okay. And you tell me if you feel comfortable. I definitely will let you know. Thank you. [Sally] That's no problem. [Sha'Carri] I don't wanna look ashy. I want to look like a brown skinned girl on camera. [Sally] You are a brown-skinned girl. So yes, of course. [Sha'Carri] I just wanna make sure that that's emphasized. [Sally] Yes. [piano playing] [upbeat music] [Sha'Carri] My family, they never allowed me to forget who I am and where I come from. Little do they know, they recharged me. I can go do this. I can go outta the world and handle never comes my way because I know when I come home that this is gonna continue to be my fuel. [upbeat techno music] That energy is becoming a new world in itself. I feel like in other sports they show that, you know, athletes can be fashionable just as much as they can be athletes. We glam up, like we put it on, we step forward, we are ready no matter what. Look good, feel good, do good. That all relates to the mental aspect, the emotional aspect, and ultimately the physical. [ethereal music] More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast.

              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account   Released on 07/01/2024 That is a ridiculous question. Can I ask, who wrote these things? Who wrote that one? Who wrote yes or no? We have had enough. Hi, I'm- Hi. Hi. I'm Joey King. I'm Nicole Kidman. That's so true, and- We're here with Vogue. We are here with Vogue, and we're doing Off the Cuff questions. 'Cause that's just [Both] The kinda gals we are. Nicole? Get to it. I'm so thrilled to sit with you. Round one. Yeah. Icebreakers. My first question, Nicole, when did we first meet? On set, no, no, in the rehearsal. Oh, I thought you might remember. Oh no [chuckling]! We met, no, no, no, we did meet in rehearsal, we met in Richard's office, and you were wearing this gorgeous, like, linen pant, and a really beautiful top- But that's the rehearsal, that's still rehearsal. Yeah. I thought you were saying I didn't remember, oh. I was agreeing with you, I was saying I thought you'd remember and I was- Woo! What was your first impression of me? I love that question. [Nicole laughing] No, that's not- Let's talk about me. My question was conceited too. That's my Miss Piggy. My first impression of you, well- Yeah, good, what's next? You are the worst, you never let me finish a compliment, you cut me off every time. When I met Nicole I had such an amazing idea of who she was going to be, 'cause I was such a fan of hers, of course and. When you love someone so much and you just know like the concept of them, not them personally, you have no idea what to expect, but she was so, I always thought Nicole was so angelic. Best person ever, the nicest person, the funniest, most talented, all right, I'm done, you can relax now. Nicole, what are you listening to right now, music wise? Billie Eilish. Ooh, love. I love that she dropped the whole album. Me too, what she- Loved it. I love the whole album, very, very much so. Um-hm, yeah, yeah. And the, just discovering, it's my album now of the summer, so that's, that. Love that. But I'm also listening to Keith's album HIGH. Oh lovely. Which has not dropped yet, doesn't come out until September. Okay, husband plug, love that. Yeah, 'cause we've both got husbands. Yes we do. Let's give your husband a plug. Yes, we should, Steven, love you baby. [Joey blowing a kiss] [both laughing] What's an item you would never leave the house without, Joey? I never leave the house without Claritin, but I do love a good eye drop too, that's gonna, I don't know, I feeling like I'm all pharmaceutical- You're very pharmaceutically inclined here. Okay, so my mother... Give us a lip gloss or something. Instilled in me, I carry a big bag full of supplies. Pharmaceuticals. Yes, for the day. I always have peppermint pills in case I get a stomachache. Oh, oh. I always have, I never leave the house- Good tip. Without LACTAID, I never leave the house, that's what it is. Good to know. Ooh, here's a nice one, I like this one. Okay. What's a sound or a sensation, hear the alliteration, What's a sound or a sensation you love? What's that A-S? ASMR? I love the sound of a hairbrush through hair, especially if I'm not doing it myself, if I'm getting my hair done, and a hairbrush- Yeah. Is running through my hair. Especially one of those bristly, like- [Nicole making hmm sounds] [shhhh] I'm like, it gives me the tingles. I'm feeling it now. I love that feeling so much. Yeah. I'm like, it feels like a warm hug. Yeah. Yeah, I love that sound. Sensation wise- That is... It's kind of a similar thing, it's both of the sound and sensation. I'm taking that as a sensation. Nicole, I've got the opposite question for you. Yeah. What's a sound or sensation that bothers you? Nails down a chalkboard. Like I'm one of, I'm just the classic, isn't that a classic? But another sensation I love, put your arm out, is this. The best sensation... Awesome. Ever when you have someone tickle your arm a little bit. Right in the, yeah, in that spot, but right aahh. Yeah [laughing]. Okay. Fill in the blank if you don't like, blah, we can't be friends. Nicole Kidman. Oh. If you don't like Nicole Kidman we can't be friends, sorry. Sometimes I wish, blank? Sometimes I wish I could fly. Sometimes I wish all hotels had bidets. I don't think I've ever wished for a bidet. Really? No. You're missing out, are you kidding me? I'm so not European, right? What was the strangest audition experience? I auditioned for Fargo and I wore a wig because I was bald, and then I realized I forgot to tell them I was wearing a wig in the audition, 'cause my head was so like lumpy and weird 'cause it was like a really bad, it was a costume wig basically, then I doubled down, I was like, oh my god, they really hate me 'cause they think I've got a weird head and I wound up getting the part, which was wonderful. Of course. That was a very strange audition 'cause I was so self-conscious and itchy and my head had a wig on it and I was bald underneath, it was a lot, a lot of things going on. Okay, round two, career questions. Oh, we're into round two, yeah. We're into round two. What's something you've learned about yourself, or your craft, when making Family Affair? I learned that comedy- Quickly! Oh my god [laughing]. I learned that comedy is really, I mean, comedy is very hard, it's true, but it's super fun, and it's really, really fun when you're able to do it with people who are super non-judgmental and so welcoming and accepting. So I learned meet your heroes because it works out. Perfect. And that's you. Okay, Nicole. Family Affair is the first- Yeah. Romantic comedy you've done in seven years, why now? What was the one seven years ago? They didn't brief me on this part. Oh, okay, I'm not sure. Why now? Because I needed to have a lightness of being because I'd come off a number of roles that were very, very heavy. Very heavy. And for my sanity I went, I need to make something about love and I need to have hope and I need to- Yep. I need to have some fun. Amazing answer. If you could send your 10-year-old self one message from the future, what would that be? You got to meet Zac Efron, you did, and you got to work with him, and you're not married to him, but you are so happy to be his friend and it's great. [Nicole laughing] Favorite advice- Yeah. You give to young actors, hello. Never give up. Okay. Keep at it. Read a lot. Find out who you are, and do not deny the things that make you different, embrace them. Love. Favorite costume from one of your films? Bullet Train. Bullet Train. Bullet Train I had a really cool costume. Yeah. It was like this very innocent little girl type, like school girl- Yeah. All pink outfit. Yeah. I was an assassin. Yeah. I loved that. That was great. Who is someone you'd love to collaborate with in the future? Isabelle Huppert. Uh, love Isabelle. Um-hm. Okay, good. Obsessed. Do you remember what you wore on your first ever red carpet? God, I've had some really bad red carpets, good god! Haven't we all. Honestly, I don't remember my first, but one of my firsts, was like I was in a movie called, Horton Hears a Who! What? I was in that movie, it was a animated movie called, Horton Hears a Who! with Jim Carrey, the elephant movie. Oh wow, yes, yes! I was in that, and I wore a cute little like, I think it was from Gymboree, a polka dot little dress, and my mom did my hair in pigtails. Oh baby, baby! I know. And speaking of round three, fashion questions. [Joey laughing] Nicole, a wardrobe piece, or souvenir you've kept, or wish you kept, from one of your films? I wish I kept the pink feathers from Moulin Rouge. I thought you would say that. Cause they're so beautiful. I wish I kept the glasses from, Eyes Wide Shut, everything- All this stuff. And I keep nothing. You don't? No. Oh. Terrible, but I do keep all my couture dresses. Tell me, where is this from? Hmm. Oh, I know where that's from. Oh? I do, that is my dress in, We Were the Lucky Ones in the opening, the moment where we see me with my partner- Yes. For the first time. Tell me where this is from, Nicole? Oh, there it is, by the way. Oh yeah, there it is. Answer, tell me where this is from? Birth. Uh, what [laughing]? Okay, Expats. It's not from, I think it's from Expats. And this, Nicole, I mean, come on, oh wait, I wait, wait- And this? This one? [Joey laughing] Wait, no, you first, and this one? Uh, To Die For. Yes, very good, and here's the image. At least I passed something. [indistinct] One of my favorite [smooching]. And this, and this? I went to Cannes recently and that's my little peekaboo keyhole in the back of the dress that I was wearing. Good Lord. [light jazz music] Lightening round, round- This is like, it's very stressful. Round four. Vogue, you're meant to not be so stressful. I know, are you having... Okay, salty or sweet? I think I'm scared. Salty or sweet? What, what, what? Salty or sweet? Sweet. Coffee or matcha? Both. I literally have both, a coffee and then a matcha. I love it. Thank you. She can't be labeled. Thank you. Country Music Awards or Academy Awards? Sorry, Academy Awards, I mean not sorry, Huh! I mean, sorry Keith, I guess. Oh! Oh wait, we are asking- Okay. Each other the wrong ones. Oh god, Country Music Awards or Academy Awards? So yeah, that's your question. Both. Both. Yeah, we mess up, okay, sorry. I started asking the questions from me to her, which is kind of interesting. But I actually thought it was the, we messed up. I'm a lefthanded lateral creature so that's what we're gonna do. Are you left-handed too? That's what we're gonna do. Yeah. I'm left-handed too. Yeah. Oh my god. See. Oh my god, okay. Theater or film? Okay, I'm just gonna say both to everything 'cause I'm not a big- Nicole, it's a game of choosing. No, I will not choose. You have to. I've had enough, I'm not choosing. I swear to god. Early bird or night owl? Early bird. Next, inside or outside? Don't say both. Outside. Okay. Yesterday or tomorrow? Oh, that's kinda nice, yesterday. What about now? Nope. My answer's- Not on there. Come on. Nope. My answer's- Not on there. I thought you were gonna- You gave me a hard time, what's your answer- But I thought you were gonna say like, ah- Yesterday or tomorrow? That's so, tomorrow. Yes or no? What? Depends. Depends, no, you can't, now you can't do that 'cause you made- Of course. You gave me grief. That is a ridiculous question, can I ask who wrote these things? Who wrote that one? Who wrote yes or no? We have had enough. Nicole and I- Naughty or nice? Now I'm making up my own. Yeah, better question than yes or no? Yeah. Naughty. Yeah, thank you. Naughty? Absolutely! Absolutely! Trick or treat? Okay, I'm done. I had- Trick and treat. A great time sitting here with the one and only, Nicole Kidman, answering questions that- The one and only Joey King. We're not to sure if we loved all of them, but we had a good time. Nope, we have now, we are protesting. Thank you Vogue for having us. Thank you Vogue. We love you. For having us. I know you'll never have us back, but hey, it was fun while it lasted. Please have us back. [cards thumping on table] Please have us back we had so much fun. Love you, watch our movie, please, thank you. [Nicole blowing kisses] [light jazz music] [light jazz music continues] More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account   Released on 06/30/2024 ♪ I'm working late 'cause I am a singer ♪ ♪ That's me espresso ♪ [Speaker] Why are you Irish? [gentle melodic music] Hey, Vogue. This is Molly Gordon and this is my I'm just getting by look. I'm gonna put these clips in. I usually love to light a candle, to kind of set an energy for me to be alone to put on my makeup. I'm loving this one. My friend Micha gave it to me. And the energy is set. Then if I wake up and I look like a ghost that was murdered, I'm very lucky that my makeup artist hooked me up with this TheraFace. You know, I used some fancy cleansers and things, but I just always go back to the original, the OG, what I used in middle school. I put on this SOS spray and it kind of just wakes me up a little bit more. So then I'm gonna use some Avene. We should all have a Google Doc as ladies to kind of talk about the journey that you take in your late twenties of getting back to the acne that you had when you were 13, and it shocks you. And ultimately a pimple can rock a day. Next I'm gonna use this retinol. Oh, I'm getting a call. Hey. [Ayo] What are you doing? What's up? I'm doing my makeup for one of those Vogue things. [Ayo] Okay. Okay, camera 28 spotted. Yeah. Do you have anything to say to them? [Molly laughing] If you had to say something that you've learned about makeup, what would you share? [Ayo] Are you serious right now? Yeah. That I've learned about makeup is that you have to find what works for you, you know? And yeah. And you also have to always put something in front of your- Oh yeah, I haven't been doing that. We've been sending each other videos every morning of procedures that we're not gonna get. But I'll just say, Ayo and I might come back next year with completely different faces. And I just wanna be honest that that's gonna happen because I'm just like, I don't know what... I don't really know what... [Ayo] Don't put the glasses over the skin. Oh, you're right. Fuck. That's a don't. That's a don't. Wait, but Ay, quickly, before you go to set, what was that lip combo you were wearing the other night that I went, Okay... So my best friend gave me some like Korean jelly lip tints. Yeah. Okay. [Ayo] From this brand Romand... Wait, hold up. Should I be giving this information for free or... Where's my video at now? Thank you Vogue for all your support of me, really. So then I did the Glossier, like the lip balm underneath, then a little bit of the tint, then the Dior lip gloss over it. And the lips were giving Smuckers jelly. It was so delicious. It was delicious. It was delicious. It was giving Smuckers, it was delish. [Ayo] Call me after this video. Okay. [Ayo] This is obviously all getting cut. Obviously. No, it's printed. This is shot on film, don't worry. Okay, love you so much. Bye. We are very lucky that she just tuned into that because we've been very lost without her. Let's dive into eye cream. I use like this much, I feel like I wish I wore more sunscreen when I was younger. I wish I used more eye cream. And I'm trying to like take it really seriously now because I be seeing it on my face. I look tired. And the show does intense closeups, which are a beautiful way to shoot. But sometimes I'm like, oh, that girl does not look well. I am gonna put on some sunscreen. I love Aquaphor. If you know me, you know I have like 75 in my bag at all times. I'm always offering it to people. So first I think I'm gonna do my eye makeup, which has been a real journey for me. I used to wear very intense Amy Winehouse thick eyeliner for like all of middle school and all of high school. And then one day I was like too tired to put it on, so I just went to school with no makeup and this guy came up to me and he was like, You look really tired today, Molly. And I was like, okay, I guess I'm gonna wear that for the rest of my life. So that stopped about a year ago, and now I am rocking a more natural look. I underline my top line with the Westman Atelier liner in brown, so it's not so intense. Great. And then I'm gonna take this Chanel eyeliner and attempt this. How cute is this? But I keep my mini Q-tips in here for eyeliner. I'm fixing it, but I've ultimately taken it all off. So that's great. It's not really even, but that is not what we're going for. We're going for that we have done it and we have attempted it. So then next I usually do the Chanel water tints. And I mix two colors. Like, kind of like that much. This much. I just like to be able to see your actual skin. I think embracing... Oh, and... ♪ I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer ♪ That really just happened. Okay, so... So things happen and... Okay. Okay. We've gotten rid of what the fuck that was. Take two of the water tints. Next I'm gonna do NARS concealer. I've been using this for probably 20 years. And then if I want to do a little bit more coverage, I'll do this Hollywood Flawless filter by Charlotte Tilbury. And I'll just kind of like put a little bit everywhere. I think I'm also too old to be doing this, but let's do some freckles. Just kind of accentuating what I already have. On The Bear it's very natural makeup, which I love. But yeah, I would love to do something that's like period piece or something like Moulin Rouge or like playing a crazy character role and have wild makeup. So now I'm gonna go in with this bronzer. Makes all of the like other stuff just look a little bit more lived in. Next I'm gonna mix these two Chanel blushes. I love blush. Sometimes overdoing blush. So then if I've like put on a little too much blush, sometimes I'll like just go back in with this randomly to kind of just be like, let's calm that down. And then I also... This I've been using since I was like 11. It's the best and it just makes you feel like you've been kissed. Next we're gonna do mascara. I'm gonna use the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow gel. I used to pluck my brows. I used to get them waxed. I used to do the whole thing and then hives down my face. It was honestly when I started trying to act professionally, like maybe getting a job or two, a makeup artist was like, Please never touch your brows. Please never do anything with them. And that was like a time stopped. It was like everything everywhere, all at once. And I was like, I will not touch my brows. And from that point on I haven't. Now highlighter, been kind of almost summer and let's get a little flirty and fun. Sometimes I'll put a little bit like in the corner of my eye. And now let's get into lips. Obviously the least original thought ever. I'm a Pillow Talk girl. And I'll kind of overline my lips. I have a mole on my lip that everyone asks me if it's chocolate because I'm always eating. I'll put some Aquaphor on. And then maybe I'll go back in with the Benetint. We're kind of done with the makeup side. So then I would set it with this Tatcha spray. Then I'm gonna take out these clips. I'm gonna take this rose oil. And if I put too much on my hands, I'll also put it on my body and kind of put it through my hair. This is the Everyday Oil. It's really delish and smells really good and is all natural and is lovely. Thank you so much for having me, Vogue. I wanna thank the cast of this video, me, Ayo Edebri, these peonies. I hope everyone has a fantastic summer. I'm putting on my hat. Facts forever. And I'm ready to go. Bye Vogue. More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account   Released on 06/26/2024 [gentle music] Hey Vogue, it's Alex Cooper. Today I am going to be showing you my skincare routine and I'm also gonna recreate my wedding makeup look. So let's get into it. I have an honest thing to share with you right off the bat. I don't wash my face. No, please don't judge me. I just realized that like early on when I was breaking out a lot, my skin was super oily and it was confused and I was struggling a lot with my skincare and when I stopped washing my face, all of a sudden, I stopped having pimples. I had no idea what toner was about two years ago. So I just put a little bit in my hand here. It is really hydrating to my skin. And everything I put on my face, I want to try to maintain some form of hydration. We all wanna look like that Hailey Bieber donut. This is the Advanced Snail Mucin. I'll do like two little squirts there. I will say this has been the one product that has kept my skin more hydrated, I would say, past 20 minutes. I feel like whenever I'm putting on serums, I find that it feels amazing in the moment and then all of a sudden, I'm like downstairs making my coffee and I'm like, my face is already dry. This keeps me glowing. The next step, I remember, I think it was like four years ago, I saw Hailey Bieber in one of her YouTube videos and this was sitting in her bathroom and immediately I'm like online like I must look like Hailey Bieber and have that skin. Honestly, I would say it was about like two years ago, I really started to care about my skin and I know that's insane 'cause I'm 29 years old. But I didn't really know the answers and there's so much information online, so I just started to kind of eyeball it and try different things and now I feel like I figured out my place and I know it works for me. This is something I've been using recently and I love it and it, again, gives me that hydrated feel and it can't hurt to be more hydrated. I do find I've started to meditate more. My mother is really into that, so I'm like, You know what mom? We're from the same DNA. I should probably lean into that. So I've been trying to meditate more. I'm not gonna lie, it's quite hard with your phone 'cause I'm constantly like, hmm, and I'm like looking down at my phone. I'm naturally very fair and I have quite a lot of freckles, so we're trying to mitigate the damage. I'm using this EltaMD. So chapstick is a huge part of my life. Anywhere you look for me, you'll see this chapstick somewhere, Burt's Bees Pomegranate. I really don't even use it for chapstick. I use it because it has this really, really nice tint. Like sometimes Matt will come home and be like, I got you a Burt's Bees. And I'm like, It's not the pomegranate one though, Matt. This just feels right to me. If something feels right, you stick with it. And I think something I realized also from social media was like I would look at someone doing something online and be like, I have to go buy that. What works on someone doesn't work on all of us. Okay, so now on to makeup. Something that was really important to me on my wedding day was making sure I looked like myself. First things first. This is the Laura Mercier Pure Canvas Primer. This is my favorite foundation at the moment, the Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation. It deserves all the hype. I have been wearing this now I would say for about a year and I have never gotten more compliments on my skin. Okay, so I know this looks like way lighter than my skin tone. Don't freak out, don't panic. Trust me, trust me, trust me. There's a method to the madness. [gentle music] When I'm doing my makeup, I know, don't come for me, okay. I have to constantly wipe my lips off. I have always had an appetite to do more than just podcasting. I went to school for film and television. I always wanted to be a director. I've always wanted to direct a film, which I probably, hopefully, at one point, will do. Let's manifest it right now. When I saw Alix Earle online and how hard she works on TikTok, I was like, She's a workhorse and she's an animal and she's so smart and so Alix was the first person for the Unwell Network where, when we started to conceptualize it, she really just like embodied everything that I wanted to do. Wait, we have to pause. The Mario Contour stick. Everything I'm about to draw on my face, I learned from someone else. So this is from actually my makeup artist who did my wedding. And this is not just me randomly painting on my face. And I'm still obsessed with Call Her Daddy and I still plan on doing Call Her Daddy, but I have an appetite to do more. [gentle music] We're just kind of blending, oh my God, I always do this where I almost forget the nose. If we really wanna snatch it, you go up. I think this just kind of like gives you a little lift. If I'm honest, I used to be really, really insecure about my freckles and I would do foundation to the point where like people would be like, I didn't even know that you had freckles. Now I think it's beautiful to just lean into my skincare and just be like, this is how I was born. Let's lean in. Sometimes what I like to do is lightly, lightly go back in with the Giorgio. [gentle music] It's really cool because I was talking to everyone that I work with and I recognized that of my list in 2022 of dream guests, I had 10 dream guests and I think I got seven out of the 10 dream guests. My dream guests for Call Her Daddy of 2024 would probably be Taylor Swift, obviously. I would be insane if I didn't want Taylor Swift. She is just iconic and I think she is so, so incredible and talented and I love her and I love her music. Taylor, please come on Call Her Daddy. This is a cream blush. It's from Nudesticks. I use Pink Ice. I love it. It works pretty well. I kind of put it all over my cheeks. I don't know if this is the wrong thing to do, but I think it makes me look alive. The next thing I'm gonna do is my highlighter. It is from Anastasia Beverly Hills. It's the Glow Seeker highlighter. Why do we put it on our nose again? I don't know. We wanna look like a little fairy. Like a little twinkling princess. My eyebrows are, how would you say, naturally translucent. So I dye my eyebrows myself 'cause I'm a genius and I'm so good at it. No, I've had a lot of mishaps with my eyebrows. Honestly, it's been a disaster. Because the brows are dyed, we're just gonna go in with this Anastasia Brow Styling Wax. I will be honest, when I was getting married, leading up to my wedding, I was having a mental breakdown because I'm like, when do I dye the brows? And so I did it four weeks before my wedding. Thank God I trusted myself. We did the thing, we dyed them, and I think they looked great. And even if they didn't, don't tell me because, for my mental health, we need to just pretend it was amazing. And now I go in and fill it in with a pencil, Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Whiz Dark Brown. So in the front, I basically just do tiny little strokes. [gentle music] Okay, the last piece of my makeup routine is going to be my mascara. I have like pretty naturally long lashes. My left eye, I was naturally born, this is bright white eyelash and this is a brown eyelash. So whenever I'm dying my eyebrows, I also st stick a little bit on there. Oh yeah, there's the blonde seeping through and then this one is naturally brown. Okay, so I use this Glossier mascara. I feel like I could go get married right now, Matt, let's do it again. So obviously, seventh grade Alex, on the way to the seventh grade dance, would put this on her body and she knew the boys were gonna come over. No boys came over. Viva la Juicy. I don't know it, I don't use it every day, but when I'm feeling like I wanna feel cozy and nostalgic, like put me in. [gentle music] It just gives a little, like this glossy finish. I feel like we killed it. I'm happy with the way it turned out. I do really feel like it looks like what I did in Mexico for my wedding. So I hope you guys learned a little something from this or you learned what not to do. Daddy Gang, I love you. Vogue, I love you. Thank you for having me.

              " \"Find anything you save across the site in your account   Released on 06/25/2024 [lively music] We should have decanted this. Jesus Christ, I missed my mouth. Chef [exhales]. That's the sign of quality right there. Look at that. Hi, Chef. How are you? [Post mumbling] You look sharp. Hi Vogue, I'm Chef Mario Carbone. And I'm Post Malone, unfortunately. What are we making and drinking today? We are making a fancy mozzarella stick, also known as mozzarella in carrozza. And a little drink, non-alcoholic, almond and lemon refresher. Speaking of refreshers, let's have a beer. [gentle music] This is the most important food group for me. Cheers. Absolutely. Let's get this thing going. Let's get down. Chef, how do we make this dish? Very carefully, no. Step one, we're gonna make our own mozzarella today. Sure. This is the curds. And all this is gonna need is hot water and salt. Sure. And this is gonna make mozzarella. And that's gonna be the center of our sandwich. And then we're gonna fry that sandwich. Oh my God. Crispy golden brown delicious. Oh my God, absolutely. And then when it's finally done, it's gonna run, and it's gonna be the Italian flag in the middle. Are you serious? I'm serious. Let's fucking go! Ingredients. Flour. Correct. Eggs, breadcrumbs. Triple virgin olive oil. No. Not gonna use it, but it looks good there. My side, you got mozzarella curd, a beautiful basil pesto we just made, beautiful Sicilian tomato concentrate, salt for our mozzarella, good old American white bread, and some milk to cool down the mozzarella that we're about to make. Does it melt pretty quick? It does melt really quick, but you need to have, like, cook's hands 'cause it's hot and you need to work with it when it's really hot. So I'll let you do that part. I thought you were gonna do that. Well, I can't. I didn't bring my mozzarella gloves. [Chef sighs] They're at the hotel. Oh yeah, I need an apron too. You need an apron. Yes, please. This feels awesome. Yeah. I'm not gonna lie to you. You look sharp now. I'm sweating my ass off, but. I'm making some mozz. Okay. All right, you ready? A lot of salt 'cause this doesn't really taste like anything on its own. Hot water. [upbeat music] I can ladle. Can you ladle my curd? I think so. You ladle my curd. If I had a nickel. Look at that. So we're gonna get rid of this water now and here's where the stretching comes in. So to make a ball out of it, you kind of like push it up through here and... No shit. And then it goes into the cold milk. Can I try that? Yeah. Look at that, I squeeze that off. Look at that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Squeeze that off. There you go. [scoffs] Fresh mozz. Come on, man. That's pretty cool. A beautiful thing. Look at that, that's pretty freaky. That one's mine. Let's taste it right now. [Post] I think it needs more salt. Let's find out. [upbeat music continues] Needs a little bit of salt. I knew it. Hold it. Oh my god. This is gangster. How often do you find yourself cooking at home? Never. You're hungry, what do you do? Red Baron pizza. Preheat the oven 425. We're gonna make a non-alcoholic drink. Pretty quick recipe. Fresh lemon, Sir. Almond syrup, ice, club soda. Two ounces of the almond syrup. Then some really nice fresh lemons. So cocktail for you. Is there anything more than just cracking open a Bud Light? Or are you getting into the bar? Screwdrivers. So no one can really bitch at me because I am getting the vitamins that I need. You can probably actually make drinks. Me, I just get like some SUNNYD and an ice cube and Tito's. SUNNYD is the base of a cocktail? SUNNYD is amazing. I don't even care. Or you can even use Tang. If it's the apocalypse, you can use Tang for your screwdrivers. You're just eyeballing this kind of stuff? Yeah, you know. That's just muscle memory. I mean, there's a recipe somewhere, but. Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. I think that's one of the most darnedest refreshing treats that I've had today. Today? Yeah, last week. Of all time. It's fucking amazing. So you making a conscious effort to dip into the country? I mean, that's your body these days. Yeah, I wanted to make a record like this for a long time. So we went to Nashville and wrote a bunch of amazing songs. I'm having so much fun writing with the buddies and just making music. It's like if I wanna make Schezwan chicken and not rigatoni tonight. Give it a fucking go. Or you make Schezwan chicken rigatoni. Someone write that down. Write that down. Write that down. Write that down. All right, for the love of God, let's make these mozzarella sticks. Yes sir, absolutely. We're gonna make our mozzarella in carrozza. What you're gonna do is you're gonna put tomato paste on one side. Yes, Chef. [Chef] And pesto on the other side. Yes, chef. How much? Like a nice shmear. Okay. Do you listen to music while you cook? At home when I'm cooking, I like to listen to opera. How you doing here? Terrible. [bright orchestral music] All right, I'm gonna clean this up a little bit. Sure. Tell me about what you eat when you're on tour 'cause that's gotta be really difficult. Yeah. So I do like an intermittent fasting. Yeah. Most of the time what I try to do is do a grilled chicken with rice, some kind of veggie, and like a hot sauce. So you only eat once a day? Once a day after the show. And then I drink a lot of liquid bread. Finish these mozzarella's now! For the love of God! Crack a couple eggs. [gentle music] This one is tough. It's a tough egg to crack. [Chef scoffs] Fuck! You're doing extraordinary. Fuck, fuck. I think that's good. We're so close. You like that? That's nice. That's what you wanted. That's what I want, yeah. It's nice. You can stop at any time. Last step of the process here. [jazzy music] Toss that guy around, just coat that. Just get a nice even coat. Just nice even coat. Like a terrier. Like a full trench. Like a light coating, you know? Fall trench? Yeah, I was going with the Vogue thing. We're almost there. These beautiful mozzarella sticks are about to go into the deep fryer and be the best bite you've had all day. But before that- All day. I'm quite thirsty. [both chuckle] Whoo! You're in luck, motherfucker. Stick your pinky up, please? Oh, yes sir. Absolutely, yes sir, I'm so sorry. [both exhale] [Both] Let's fry these motherfuckers. [crew laughing] [screen beeps] Let's fry these motherfuckers. [Director] Oh wait, my bad. Oh, fun. [screen beeps] [Both] Let's fry these motherfuckers. [rock music] We're about to eat these bad boys, but it's fucking Vogue, and I need you back in your suit. You got it. I quit! [Chef laughing] All right, time to eat some mozzarella sticks. Two ways that I'd go about dipping this, right? Sure. Dip is critical here. We have anchovy emulsion, also known as Caesar salad dressing. Okay. But then the Italian American would just, you know, put some sauce on the side. Let's get after it. Just do it, just do it. Okay. Go. I'm looking for a crispy. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers, man. Good work. [food crunching] Mm-hmm, wow. Your Italian flag. Look at that cross section. [jazzy music] Just wash it down. Look at this. Like a gentleman. This is amazing, mm, mm. Banging stick. Whoa. Look at that stretchy lad. Oh, that's the sign of quality right there. Look at that. You should do this. Really good job. Yeah. Thank you, Vogue. Thank you, Vogue. Thank you for having us. What'd we make today? We made mozzarella in carrozza with Post Maloney. And Carbone. Thank you for coming. I love you. [funky music] More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. We all have long and arduous days, but some of us are better equipped to deal with them than others. As a longtime stress-head of the finest variety, I have found the transition from busy and adrenaline-fuelled work days to rest and recovery at home a difficult one—my Oura ring often informs me that I am “adequate” at balancing my stress load, which is the AI version of telling me it’s “disappointed.” What to do about this sorry state of affairs? Turns out, it’s as simple as shaking it out. “The main thing is to connect with the body and the sensations that have come up,” explains Dr Safia Debar, who runs the Harvard Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) at The Mayo Clinic. “Just like animals in the wild will shake (or tremor), which releases all the energy from the increased cortisol and adrenaline coursing through them, it’s a similar thing for humans. We make adrenaline and cortisol, which primes the body for fight, flight, or freeze, and if we don’t expend this energy, it gets stored.” Since the majority of us are not fleeing danger on the Serengeti, but, slightly comically, experiencing our stress while sedentary in an office, much of our extra cortisol and adrenaline remains in the body, which in turn impacts how we feel and move. “Some form of shaking movement is a good way to release. I usually advise starting with a few minutes and then seeing how it impacts the body. Combined with breathwork, it can help restore us to baseline,” she says. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard this. At an event to celebrate her new book, Soothe, Nahid de Belgeonne a somatic movement educator, breath and yoga teacher, who is also known as the “nervous system whisperer” demonstrated one easy way to help the body and mind switch off at the end of the day. It involves a kind of shaking-meets-rocking movement while lying on the floor—she calls it “jiggling.” Designed to calm an overstimulated nervous system, this rocking movement “provides deep pressure and joint compression, which can help to modulate arousal levels, promoting a more balanced and calm state.” We get tense and tight trying to contain our many feelings, and rocking essentially releases a cascade of endorphins, helping to shift us into a more relaxed state. All you have to do is lie on the floor and connect to your body, then gently press your heels into the ground until your knees bend a little and your calves and thighs come away from the floor. Then, you rock your heels on the floor, backward and forward, letting the motion move your body (allow it to be floppy) from heels to head. Stop and start this movement, noticing how you feel in between spurts, for around five to 10 minutes. It sounds simple—and perhaps a bit wacky—but when De Belgeonne referenced the fact that parents rock their children to soothe them, it all made a lot of sense as to why it helps us years later. She is also a fan of more vigorous shaking: “It’s a natural response to your body to release itself from a fixed state,” she says, explaining that it releases a surge of chemicals in the body, and thereby releases them from both body and brain, undoing the damage caused by stress. So, how will you shake? Well, in the first instance, you can treat your body like jelly and let movement travel through each part of it, however, it comes to you. It will feel weird at first, but it works. You can also spend time dancing or bouncing around listening to music, which is another key activity the experts recommend. Or, Dr Debar also recommends yoga (hip opening poses, in particular) and TRE, also known as trauma release exercise, examples of which can be found online. While I spend a lot of time feeling stressed in my own head, both experts have taught me to let my body do the processing… sometimes, feeling cool, calm, and collected is understanding that body and mind are intrinsically linked, and, try as you might, you can’t think yourself out of a stressed state. Sometimes, all it takes is putting an excellent tune on, and putting the world right with a little shake.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. If one were to extrapolate any kind of wisdom from the first game of the Wimbledon men’s final—which pitted third-seeded Carlos Alcaraz against second-seeded Novak Djokovic—it would likely be: We are in for one of the greatest—and longest—finals matches in Grand Slam history. That game, which lasted 13 minutes and featured 20 points and seven deuces, seemed a harbinger of epic things to come. (Think about it this way: If the match continued like that—even assuming it was won in three straight sets, say 6-4, 6-4, 6-4—it would have lasted six and a half hours.) The crowd—which included the Princess of Wales (in only her second public appearance, following June’s Trooping the Colour ceremonies, since disclosing her cancer diagnosis and treatment) and her daughter, Charlotte, in the Royal Box, along with Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Cruise, Paul Mescal, and tennis legends Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Chris Evert, Stan Smith, and Stefan Edberg—settled in for a classic. Alas! That game was an outlier, not a predictor. Rather than witness a match for the ages, we saw a new kind of dominance emerge, with Alcaraz playing at a level that Djkokovic simply couldn’t match and defending his title in a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 near-romp. (There was one significant wobble in an otherwise flawless day from Alcaraz: Having won every point but one in what should have been the last two games of the match, and serving for the title at 40-0, he somehow let Djokovic steal the game, ultimately leading to a tiebreak to decide the match—which Alcaraz won handily, 7-4.) “It wasn’t meant to be,” Djokovic—who was contesting his tenth(!) straight Wimbledon final—conceded after the match. “[Alcaraz] had it all today.” Standing with the Princess of Wales, Alcaraz lifts the Challenge Cup after his Wimbledon win on Sunday. Why the disparity in playing levels today, after what most experts predicted would be an evenly fought war of attrition, endurance, and strategy? The obvious culprit would be the knee surgery Djokovic had on June 5 to repair the torn medial meniscus he suffered during the French Open. Djokovic has worn a sleeve on his repaired leg throughout the tournament—but if he was pushing his recovery faster than strictly advised, he also had an extraordinarily easy path to the final, with easy matches and a walkover. And then, of course, there’s age: Alcaraz is 21, arguably at the exact apex of his career in terms of fitness, and perhaps—this is almost frightening to consider—still gaining and growing in terms of court wisdom and playmaking strategy. “In an interview when I was 11 or 12 years old, I said that it was a dream of mine to win Wimbledon,” Alcaraz said after the match. “I’m fulfilling that dream—for me, this is the most beautiful tournament, the most beautiful court, and the most beautiful trophy.” Then we had a brief—but crucial—insight into both Alcaraz’s humility and his edge: When asked what it was like to join the great roster of tennis legends who have won both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year—players like Laver, Bjorn Borg, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Djokovic—Alcaraz demurred. “I don’t consider myself a champion yet,” he said—and when the crowd on Centre Court simply wasn’t having that kind of talk, clarified: “Not that kind of champion.” If Djokovic, though, was lacking in this or that, Alcaraz had this or that in abundance, dominating the match with speed, power, surprise, finesse, energy, and confidence. And while many of the games were hard-fought, the outcome always seemed inevitable. This was Alcaraz’s fourth grand slam final, and he’s won all four: the 2022 US Open, this year’s French Open, and Wimbledon twice in a row. Up next for Alcaraz: The Olympics, where he’ll play both singles and—notably—doubles with the legendary Nadal. But first, though, some football: The newly crowned repeat-champion of Wimbledon was asked after the match who he was predicting to win the final of the European Championships, beginning in a few hours. Alcaraz was skillfully evasive and diplomatic in his response, saying (after a long hesitation) only: “I’ve already done my job—so… let’s see the football.” By signing up you agree to our User Agreement (including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Vogue.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. I think I might have experienced national pride for the first time in my life this week—something that’s very rare for us self-loathing Brits. I’d gone down a TikTok rabbit hole watching videos of tourists on holiday in London going to pubs to watch England play in the Euros semifinals. All of these clips were kind of similar: floppy-haired Americans and Australians making jokes about “maybe getting to see it come home?” and then capturing the reaction when, as we all know by now, it actually did. Many featured video montages of things like bus drivers honking in jubilation; middle-aged men with Jude Bellingham shirts pulled over their heads; crowds stopping traffic as they danced to “Vindaloo” in the middle of the road. And all of them showed the aforementioned tourists reacting in awe and astonishment—earnestly exclaiming things like “This is the best thing I’ve ever seen” while watching, say, a pensioner showering his Saint George’s Cross-painted head in lager. Something about seeing England fans be England fans through fresh eyes made me feel… Thrilled? Proud? Quite emotional? And it’s not just that genre of England fan video I’ve been gobbling up since the match against the Netherlands on Wednesday—the one that got our team into their first men’s Euros final on international soil. I’ve been mainlining videos of people whooping and cheering at the 47 bus to Bellingham, Catford Bus Garage like it’s the superstar footballer (and Skims model) Jude Bellingham himself, along with clips of soap star Ross Kemp grunting “Ollie Watkins, we love you, we love you, we love you,” on his Instagram Stories after the substitute scored the semi-winning goal in the 91st minute. I’ve been obsessed with footage of the crowd going nuts at the Killers’ O2 gig on Wednesday, when the band aired the final two minutes of the semifinals before storming into “Mr. Brightside”… Literally none of these things were relevant to my interests, like, last month, but now I cannot get enough. Yes, our country might be extortionately expensive to live in; yes, it might have outrageously terrible weather; but if there’s one thing that makes me genuinely feel good about being English, it’s seeing us all come together to support our beautiful boys in the silliest, rowdiest, dumbest way possible. I’d argue (excluding a few rogue awful ones) that English people are the best in the world at being international football fans. And, right now, it feels like there’s not a person in the country who’s not ready to show off that skillset. King Charles is apparently on the edge of his seat, Adele’s been biting her nails in the stands in Germany, Keir Starmer made a PR clip of himself watching England from the White House, and one London bar (unanimously recognized as terrible) is so sure people will be desperate for a place to watch that it’s charging £422 for a table for six on match night. In fact, Gareth Southgate’s squad has unified England in a way that’s only occurred two other times in recent memory: Firstly, when we all watched Rishi Sunak get drenched and drowned out by D:Ream as he announced the general election—and the likely demise of the UK’s most corrupt government in centuries—in June; snd secondly, in January, when Harry betrayed Molly to win The Traitors. Even bagging our first new government in 14 years didn’t unify the country like this. (Just a suggestion, but I’d recommend Labour Party members stop saying horrifically transphobic things if they’d like me to feel about them how I feel about the England team.) What is it about this particular Euros run that’s brought us all together? Well—I can only claim to be an expert in vibes rather than football—but I’d say there’s a giddiness in the air this time. Maybe it’s because, after a considerable number of years of hurt, this evening’s final follows some genuinely hope-inducing English Euros success. (See: 2020, when we came second to Italy by a tie-break penalty shoot-out; 2022, when our girls, the Lionesses, showed the country that England wasn’t doomed for eternal international failure; and this team’s quarterfinal, when our boys scored five out of five penalties in sudden death against Switzerland and shifted, once and for all, the longstanding perception of England being rubbish at them.) Maybe it’s because Gareth Southgate seems like a kind leader, and a win for a manager who actually cares about his players’ feelings—supporting them through media doubts and horrible hate—is kind of a win for us all? Or maybe there’s just a general sense of the “impossible being reachable” floating about the UK right now, given we’ve just had an election with a result that doesn’t appear to have totally fucked the country for the first time in decades. Whatever the case, let’s embrace it: it’s bloody coming home, isn’t it. And even if it doesn’t, at least we’ll all be unified in our horrendous post-match hangovers come Monday morning.

Sharp, captivating, and a bit rebellious, they felt thrillingly real—and were always closely associated with the woman behind them, Shannen Doherty.

She would later appear in Parker Lewis Can’t Lose, 21 Jump Street, and Heathers, alongside a young Winona Ryder, before Beverly Hills, 90210 catapulted her to teen-idol status. Doherty was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, going into remission two years later. In 2020, however, she announced that the cancer had returned; and by June 2023, it had spread to her brain. Doherty’s death was announced by her publicist, Leslie Sloane, on Saturday, July 13.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. “Dreaming is the most important thing in life.” This has been Italian tennis player Jasmine Paolini’s mantra ever since her father, Ugo, handed her her first racket at the age of five. Paolini, 28, lost the 2024 Wimbledon women’s singles final to Czech player Barbora Krejčíková on Saturday. But despite the result, it marked a historic moment in Italian tennis history: no Italian female athlete before Paolini had ever advanced so far at that major. It was a sensational, legendary match for Paolini—and no fluke. The proof was in her three-hour semifinal against Croatian Donna Vekić: Paolini won from behind, bending several times but never breaking. The Wimbledon crowd will forever remember every one of her winning shots, and her shout—“Forza!”—was nothing less than the roar of a proud and fearless spirit, one who never stops dreaming. Paolini made up for what she lacks in height (she is five-foot-three) with heart, grit, and an impressive mental resilience, even with her teary-eyed parents and her younger brother, William (also a tennis player), watching from her box. It’s impossible not to fall in love with her, with that mask of tension and its myriad expressions—from fierce gazes in the heat of competition to regretful looks for missed shots—that melts into a beautiful and contagious smile at the moment of victory. There is no doubt that 2024 is a special, unforgettable year for Paolini: just a month before Wimbledon, she also reached the singles final at the French Open, a feat that no woman has accomplished in a single season since Serena Williams in 2016. Under the guidance of her coach Renzo Furlan, Paolini—who grew up between Bagni di Lucca, in Tuscany, and Łódź, Poland (the hometown of her mother, Jacqueline, who is half Polish and half Ghanaian)—has shown the world her worth, not only as a tennis player capable of breaking into the top 10 in the world (she is currently seventh in the WTA rankings, but likely to be fifth on Monday, July 15), but as a courageous woman who never gives up. After all, sports (and in this case, tennis) are like life. And every day, you have to play the game just like Jasmine Paolini does. Vogue: Jasmine, what memories will you have of this final? Jasmine Paolini: I will have many memories. Unfortunately, the first thing that comes to mind is that I lost. But if I stop to reflect, I will always carry the emotion of playing on Centre Court, with such a warm-hearted audience. The audience loved you! Yes, and it was truly incredible to play such a match, such an important final, with all the stands full. The challenge was tough, I lost, but I have to try to see the positive side. Making it to play such an important match was something positive, undoubtedly. Your experience at Wimbledon was still a victory for you and for Italian tennis. How are you approaching the Olympics? Wimbledon was definitely a positive tournament—there’s a bit of regret for this lost final, but I have to try to be happy for these last two weeks that were wonderful. Now I’ll relax for a couple of days and then I’ll immediately try to readjust to clay again to arrive at my best for the Olympics. Are they a goal for you? Absolutely, yes, they are an important goal. They come once every four years, so I will put in maximum effort to try to do well, even though it won’t be easy. And then every tournament is different from the other. The important thing is to always have the desire to fight on every point, always trying to bring out the best. Just over a month ago you were playing the Roland-Garros final in Paris... In Paris, it was a very positive two weeks. But now I am totally focused on the present, because that’s how I concentrate, always preparing for the next tournament as best as I can. Now in my mind are the Olympics: That’s my goal. And I can’t wait to get back into the game.

Actually, I haven’t heard them very often. Those close to me have never placed this limit on me. Surely, if I had been a few centimeters taller, maybe it would have helped. But who knows? Honestly, I’m not dwelling on that right now, am I? I focus on playing with the weapons I have at my disposal. Now that you’re ranked number 7 in the world, how satisfying is it? It’s a great satisfaction, even though I don’t see it as a personal revenge. I don’t feel those kinds of sentiments or sensations. You’ve made up for your lack of height with significant agility and power in your legs. Can you tell us how you’ve worked on your physical conditioning and technique to reach such heights? Yes, to achieve these results, there has been continuous work both in terms of technique and physical training. The most important thing is to maintain consistency in the program with the athletic trainer, even during tournaments. I try to stick to it as much as possible because I believe it’s something that needs to be done every day. And of course, the technical aspect is crucial too: besides my coach [Renzo Furlan], Danilo Pizzorno, who is a video analyst, also contributes. Together, as a team, we strive every day to add one brick at a time, with the goal of improving every aspect. First and foremost, though, there’s the mindset. How do you train mentally? How much have you been able to improve this aspect over time? In the past, I’ve worked with psychologists, and mental training is definitely something I want to focus on again soon, because I think it’s very important. Above all, I’m convinced that knowing oneself better really helps improve performance on the court. You’re an example for the next generation of aspiring tennis players. What message would you like to send them? The message I would like to convey is to have fun, because that’s the most important thing. You must enjoy and have fun with what you do. It must be a true passion. But I also have another message… What is it? One should never be afraid to dream. Who has inspired you? Well, without a doubt: my generation is the one that grew up watching the rivalry between Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal. Simply legendary. What has tennis taught you about facing life? And how has life prepared you to be stronger as a tennis player? I believe tennis is a sport where you have to quickly find solutions to the challenges that arise. This includes the ones posed by your opponent and those tied to how you feel on the specific day of the match. Ultimately, the winner is often the one who is better at handling these critical moments, though luck also plays a significant role. However, they are just tennis matches in the end. Real-life problems can be outside the court. But the beautiful thing is that every point is a way to challenge yourself. What feelings do you experience before an important match? There’s some tension, and I think it’s actually beneficial. Once you step onto the court, fortunately, these feelings often, if not always, dissipate immediately. I’m someone who always tries to focus on what needs to be done on the court. How do you manage to focus and calm down? I follow my own routine, which involves warming up before the match and taking a moment for myself, trying to focus. Are you superstitious? Do you have any lucky rituals? No, I just focus on what I need to do and maintain concentration by talking with my coach. And no, I don’t have any lucky rituals before matches. The work you’ve done with Renzo Furlan has been a turning point for you. What was the thing that made you change gear? How much of tennis is a battle with yourself vs. the opponent? Before stepping onto the court, especially if I’m feeling tense or nervous, I try to talk with my coach to enter the match more calmly and peacefully. Expressing my feelings and concerns before a game reduces my nervousness and the tension that builds up before the match. I don’t think there was a specific click for me. Instead, I believe what I’m achieving is the result of daily work and certainly the many matches won. This aspect has definitely helped me gain more confidence in myself.

I started playing tennis when I was five years old, thanks to my father and uncle who played tennis at an amateur level. And how did you feel? They handed me that racket and told me to give it a try. I still remember my first lesson: I immediately liked it, and from that moment on, I never stopped. Your mother is Polish. How important was the city of Łódź for your personal growth? What do you always carry with you from this country? I carry a lot with me, especially because until I was 10 years old, I practically went to Łódź every year. I have many childhood memories with my relatives and my grandmother, so when I think of Poland, I definitely think of positive moments from my life as a child. Then, I started going less frequently due to school and especially sports commitments. But Poland remains close to my heart: learning about their history, their culture, has broadened my perspective. Your determination and grit are exemplary. They demonstrate that through hard work, one can go far. In your opinion, can one reach a point in tennis—as in life—where they’re not afraid of anything or anyone? Or is the possibility of failure always something to accept and factor in? I believe mistakes are always made, at all levels and stages of life. I think it’s important to accept our mistakes and try our best not to repeat them. But we’re human, so mistakes happen and will continue to happen. All we can do is give our maximum effort to minimize them as much as possible. Do you like fashion? I do like fashion, and actually, I have to take advantage of it to go shopping after Wimbledon [laughs]. What's your favorite piece of clothing? And what accessory is always in your suitcase? I really like skirts, and the accessory that is never missing from my suitcase is a nice bag. How important is your aesthetic side to you? Do you have a beauty routine? Yes, I have a beauty routine that I try to follow every day, especially because we tennis players are exposed to the sun for many months of the year. So, I think it’s important to take care of my skin. Let’s talk about leisure time. What do you do when you’re not training? Nothing in particular, I’m just a very normal girl. I like hanging out with my friends, watching TV series, reading a book, going out for dinner. In short, doing normal things. I don’t have something specific that I enjoy; I’m quite basic in that regard. What is your relationship with social media and your public persona? I consider myself a private person: on social media, I try to share more of my athletic side than my personal life off the court. Occasionally, I do post something personal, but it depends on how I feel. May I ask if you have a romantic relationship that is giving you additional energy on the court? How much can love help—or, conversely, distract—a professional tennis player who always needs to maintain high concentration? I’m currently not in a romantic relationship. But I think a healthy relationship can only be beneficial. What do the Olympics mean to you? A lot. I still remember when my father used to show me athletics on TV when I was a child; that’s the first image that comes to mind when I think of the Olympics. When I attended the Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony in 2021, it was a very emotional moment—a dream come true. The athlete on TV was me. This story was translated from the original Italian.

Zendaya is often spotted hanging out in London’s parks with her British boyfriend, Tom Holland—and it seems while she's there she's been taking notes on the British beauty scene. Attending the press night of Jeremy O Harris’s Slave Play at the Noel Coward Theatre on Wednesday, the actor debuted a brand new hair color, and it’s one that the Brit girlies are going wild for right now. Zendaya’s curly hair look sun-kissed and healthy in a shade of honey blonde, with a brightened-up hue around her face (aka the Scandanavian hairline). Having styled it up in a messy undone bun (an A-list favorite for summer), Zendaya paired the look with a bronze eye and flawless skin. She’s not the first celebrity to opt for a lighter, brighter, honey tone in her hair—earlier this week, Emilia Clarke also debuted a similar shade through her locks, having swapped her signature deep brunette for a sun-kissed hue. Other honey-blonde fans include Rihanna and Suki Waterhouse, both of whom have been sporting the color for a while.

There are the ones that nod to tennis whites (see: the pleated Temperley design she chose for her first Centre Court appearance as a newlywed); the polka-dotted ones (Kate’s staple summer print); the Wimbledon-green ones (she is, after all, Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club); and the wild cards (like the mint Balmain blazer she debuted in 2023). For anyone tasked with covering royal fashion, the latter are most welcome—recall her skull-, lipstick-, and butterfly-printed Alexander McQueen dress from 2016’s tournament? But if you’re simply trying to figure out what to wear for an afternoon of Pimm’s and politesse, the Princess of Wales’s turns in Jenny Packham, Alessandra Rich, and Catherine Walker are a good point of reference.

Hot, hazy, and humid weather can do a number on makeup and hair alike—but the best anti-frizz products are able to run interference, keeping frizz and flyaways at bay even in the midst of a heatwave. And despite its association with summer, frizz can happen at any point, whether your hair is damaged, curly, or simply prone to dryness; all of these can predispose you to the telltale halo around your head. For that reason, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to frizz. “Just like skincare, the right regimen is totally unique to every individual,” says Oribe global artist Adam Livermore. It’s highly dependent on your hair type and routine; for instance, someone with curls and a wash-n-go style requires a different frizz-control formula than another with a standing blowout appointment. With that in mind, the best anti-frizz products offer something for everyone. John Frieda Frizz Ease Styling Spray AMAZON Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray AMAZON ULTA Living Proof No Frizz Shampoo NORDSTROM AMAZON Garnier Sleek & Shine Anti-Frizz Serum AMAZON Redken Frizz Dismiss Leave-In Spray AMAZON ULTA Briogeo Farewell Frizz Blow Dry Cream AMAZON DERMSTORE NORDSTROM Moroccanoil Frizz Control Smoothing Lotion AMAZON NORDSTROM BLUE MERCURY Olaplex No. 6 Bond Smoother AMAZON ULTA Kérastase Anti-Frizz Hair Repair Serum AMAZON SEPHORA Adwoa Beauty Blue Tansy Hair Mask AMAZON SEPHORA SheaMoisture Curl Mousse AMAZON ULTA Oribe Priming Lotion Conditioning Detangler AMAZON NORDSTROM DERMSTORE Reverie Natural Milk Leave-In Nourishing Treatment AMAZON CREDO BEAUTY Ouai Matte Hair Pomade AMAZON SEPHORA Frizz happens when the cuticle of the hair lifts up. “It's the outermost layer of a hair strand, and hair cuticles are like shingles on a roof or scales on a fish; they are little plates that overlap each other,” says Livermore. “If the cuticles are undamaged, smooth, and flush with the hair strand, the hair will be shiny and frizz-free.” Hair can be naturally frizzy, as is the case with curls, coils, and waves, since these tend to be dry. And, “because of its thickness and larger diameter, coarse hair textures are also prone to dryness and frizz,” says Nast. That's also the case with gray hair, which has more layers of cuticle than pigmented hair. Finally, frizz can also arise from damage caused by aggressive styling or chemical processes, like color treatments, says Livermore. Anything that smoothes the cuticle of the hair can help control frizz. Silicones tend to be among the best ingredients for this, as “they lubricate the hair, smooth the cuticle down, and seal it closed,” says Livermore. Also, certain styles lend themselves to frizz control. “You can cut down on frizz by blow drying and/or flat ironing your hair,” Nast says. “This will help to close the hair cuticle, protecting it from absorbing moisture.” However, be sure to prep hair with a heat protectant first, or else the resulting damage will only incur more frizz over time. Extending your time between washes can also be helpful. “Even shampoo can slightly open and swell the cuticle,” says Livermore. “That’s why we use a conditioner afterwards—to close it back down and smooth it.” He also recommends rinsing with cold water, which can help (temporarily) seal the cuticle. Silicones, such as dimethicone, are a good place to start. However, you might also want to consider a silicone-free formula, especially if your hair is wavy or curly. “Because some silicones aren’t water-soluble and can build up on the hair, many people with curly textures prefer silicone-free products,” says Livermore. As washing hair can remove moisture, those with curls tend to wash less—leading to more potential buildup from silicones. Both Nast and Livermore recommend seeking out nourishing ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, argan oil, and jojoba oil. “These have a rich moisturizing ability that usually helps tame and smooth big, frizzy hair down,” Livermore says. Nast also points to hydrolyzed keratin as a good option, especially if you have heat or chemical damage; not only does it help repair, but it also smooths the cuticles, she says. Ultimately, the best way to address frizz is not to let it occur in the first place. To that end, “always use a heat protectant, make sure you are not over-shampooing, add a deep conditioner to your weekly routine, and get regular trims,” says Nast.

On a temperate afternoon at London’s All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Barbora Krejčíková of the Czech Republic and Jasmine Paolini of Italy both played their first Wimbledon singles final on Saturday, with Krejčíková, the 31-seed, winning the match 6-2, 2-6, 6-4. In front of a crowd that included Maria Sharapova (who won her own maiden Wimbledon title 20 years ago at the age of 17), Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, and Ashleigh Barty—as well as celebrities like Zendaya, Tom Cruise, Hugh Jackman, and Kate Beckinsale—Krejčíková turned in a nearly perfect opening set, hitting very cleanly (and very hard). With one major singles title (Roland-Garros, 2021) and seven major women’s doubles titles under her belt, she seemed calm, cool, and confident, handily overpowering the more petite (5’ 3”!) Paolini. Paolini lunging for a return during her Wimbledon final on Saturday. That opening 30 minutes clearly lit a fire: Returning to the grass after a short break, Paolini, gunning to become the first Italian Wimbledon singles champion, played a scorcher of a second set. The seventh seed—who also played in this year’s French Open final, where she lost to Iga Swiatek—completely reset the match, playing with far more control and seizing on Krejčíková’s lapse in focus. A crowd favorite throughout the tournament for her powerful forehand, her dominance at the set, and her effervescent personality, she finally gave the crowd a reason to get involved. Krejčíková celebrating championship point on Saturday. Play was more evenly matched in the third set, as Krejčíková once again showed the conviction that had won her the first set, and Paolini kept holding strong. After a series of holds, Krejčíková finally broke serve to go up 4-3, setting herself up to win the match. Despite a fierce fight from Paolini, who staved off a string of championship points, Krejčíková eventually closed out the set 6-4. She celebrated her hard-earned victory—which followed a frustrating series of injuries and illnesses over the last few years, and a three-hour opening match in this tournament—by flinging her arms into the air and then rushing into the stands to embrace her family and team.

Who says wedding guest attire stops at a dress or suit? Khloe Kardashian makes a case for an elevated braid as part of her look for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s baraat (or, a grand nuptial procession that is part of a traditional Indian wedding) thanks to celebrity hair stylist Chris Appleton. What’s even better is that the sumptuous style was entirely Khloe’s own locks. Video: Courtesy of Chris Appleton “We blow dried her hair out–because it’s so humid [in Mumbai]–and I just braided it, leaving a little bit of volume in the crown with a middle part,” explains Appleton; he felt this style best suited Khloe’s facial shape. “We then pulled [her hair] back into a french braid, braided it all the way down into a fishtail braid, and then literally just pinned in the jewelry after.” Traditionally, Indian women braid jewelry and flowers into their hair for special occasions–specifically weddings. And to kick off night one of the final weekend of celebrations, Khloe paid homage to the centuries-old tradition. The jewelry featured in the braid is from local Indian jeweler Tarun Tahiliani–which added some culture and elegance to the look. “Just a little bit of detail is a fun way to elevate the braid,” says Appleton. He also notes that costume jewelry, real jewels and even necklaces can work for a night out–and this particular style worked perfectly with [Khloe’s] outfit. 5 Anti-inflammatory Foods to Eat Regularly, According to a Nutritionist A Breakfast High in Protein For Muscles, Metabolism, and Aging Taylor Swift’s Beauty Look for the European Tour Has Changed—and, Perhaps, Hints at Her Relationship The Best Time To Take Vitamins, According To Experts Jennifer Aniston's Sun Dress And Mani Combo Is The Ultimate Cali Vibe Sign up for Vogue’s beauty newsletter to receive the insider’s guide to all things beauty and wellness Never miss a Vogue moment and get unlimited digital access for just $2 $1 per month.

              " 'Find anything you save across the site in your account  Her wide-eyed terror in The Shining (1980)—Stanley Kubrick’s horror masterpiece in which she played Jack Nicholson’s wife—is the first image that comes to mind when we think of Shelley Duvall. However, the late Texan actress, who passed away in her sleep on July 11 at the age of 75 due to severe diabetes, had a much broader film career. For one thing, there was her special collaboration with another master of cinema, Robert Altman. Altman, who essentially discovered her, cast Duvall as Millie in the acclaimed drama Three Women (1977). This tragicomic and semi-improvised role—which saw her play an employee at a seniors’ spa in the California desert, inviting a colleague, played by Sissy Spacek, to share her apartment—cemented her status as an actress to watch, won her the best-actress award at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. Shelley Duvall in Three Women, 1977 Duvall’s first encounter with Robert Altman took place at a party organized for her then-boyfriend, artist Bernard Sampson, in 1969, when she was 20. The director went on to cast her in Brewster McCloud, her first movie, where she showed a natural talent (despite some youthful awkwardness). In the following years, she would take parts in McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), Thieves Like Us (1974), Nashville (1975), and Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson (1976), all also under Altman’s direction. “He offers me damn good roles,” she said of the director in 1977. “None of them have been alike. He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn’t put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him. I remember the first advice he ever gave me: ‘Don’t take yourself seriously.’” In Thieves Like Us, 1974 Before the aforementioned Three Women, Woody Allen also noticed Duvall, and cast her in his masterpiece Annie Hall (1977), starring Diane Keaton. Although much of her performance was cut during editing, she left a strong impression as Pam, a sharply ironic Rolling Stone journalist. Then, in 1979, Duvall was summoned by the intellectually formidable Stanley Kubrick for the film that made her internationally famous: The Shining. Making that movie profoundly affected her, severely testing her mental resilience. Kubrick had her “crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end,” Duvall told People magazine in 1981. “I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me.” Shelley Duvall in The Shining, 1980 Once she had escaped the Overlook Hotel, Duvall made her seventh and final film with Altman, Popeye (1980), playing Olive Oyl (with Robin Williams as her spinach-scarfing husband). She then starred in Terry Gilliam’s 1981 black comedy Time Bandits before her appearances on the big screen sharply declined—although she continued to work with notable directors. These included Tim Burton (Frankenweenie, 1984), Steven Soderbergh (The Underneath, 1995), and Jane Campion (The Portrait of a Lady, 1996). Her final film role came in 2023, in Scott Goldberg’s The Forest Hills. Here, we celebrate Shelley Duvall’s exceptional life in images: As Suzanne Davis in Brewster McCloud, 1970 As Keechie in Thieves Like Us, 1974 As Martha/Joan in Nashville, 1975 As Millie in Three Women, 1977 As Pam in Annie Hall, 1977 More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast.

The beauty community may be abuzz right now over the latest in K-beauty, but Japan (not to pit two queens against each other) is just as much a hub of skin-care innovation as its neighbor. The best Japanese sunscreen, in particular, shines, with many travelers stocking up on their trips to the island—or going as far as asking friends to bring these coveted cosmetic staples back to the States for them. Japan has strict sunscreen regulations to ensure high standards and qualities for safety and effectiveness. “Many brands in Japan use advanced UV filters and innovative technology to make sunscreen hypoallergenic and multifunctional, meaning it can nourish your skin, moisturize, protect your skin from pollution, and even work like a primer,” explains licensed esthetician Kyoko Getz. Japanese sunscreens also offer a sensorial experience, often featuring a milky, lightweight texture that effortlessly melts into the skin. Similar to Korean sunscreens, they frequently incorporate skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and antioxidants. “These additives bolster sun protection and contribute to overall skin health, providing hydration and combating signs of aging,” says Superegg founder and licensed esthetician Erica Choi. (I really wanted to gate-keep these picks, but alas, my editor said that went against the Hippocratic oath of editorial.) Below, ten of our favorite Japanese sunscreens. Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free SPF 42 AMAZON SEPHORA Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen AMAZON YES STYLE Addiction Tokyo Skin Protector SPF 50+ YES STYLE  Biore Sarasara UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF 50 AMAZON Kose Suncut UV Perfect Essence SPF 50+ AMAZON YES STYLE Isehan Kiss Me Sunkiller Perfect Water Essence SPF 50+ AMAZON YES STYLE Canmake Mermaid Skin Gel UV Sunscreen SPF 50+ AMAZON WALMART Tatcha The Silk Sunscreen Mineral Broad Spectrum SPF 50 TATCHA Koh Gen Do Watery Spa UV SPF 50+ YES STYLE Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50 AMAZON WALMART Japanese sunscreens are renowned globally for their efficacy and user-friendly formulations. Choi explains that they typically offer SPF 50, ensuring robust protection against both UVA and UVB rays. Additionally, they use the PA rating system, with many achieving the highest grade of PA++++, indicating strong defense against UVA rays that cause skin aging and long-term damage. Plus, these sunscreens utilize advanced filters that have not yet been approved by the FDA. “Their lightweight textures absorb quickly into the skin, making them ideal for everyday use, whether under makeup or alone, especially in extremely hot summer weather. This enhances comfort and encourages consistent use,” Choi says. Unlike American sunscreens, Japanese sunscreens include both SPF (Sun Protection Factor) and PA (Protection Grade of UVA) information on the product label. While it might seem redundant, Choi explains that PA is a rating system used on Japanese sunscreens to indicate the level of protection against UVA rays. SPF measures protection against UVB rays, so you can find perfect protection against both UVA and UVB by checking the SPF and PA info on the label. The PA scale ranges from PA+ (some UVA protection) to PA++++ (extremely high UVA protection). “I would recommend SPF 30 and PA+++ for everyday use, offering good protection for daily activities, and SPF 50 and PA+++ or PA++++ for outdoor activities or intense sun exposure,” she says. Manufacturers have responded to these demands by developing lightweight textures that are easy to spread, have great consistency, provide hydration with a non-sticky finish, and offer waterproof or water-resistant functions for every consumer. While the debate between mineral and chemical filters continues, Getz personally prefers sunscreens with chemical filters for daily use due to their effective protection and clear, non-greasy feel. Some popular ingredients like Tinosorb and Uvinul are frequently used in Japanese sunscreens for their broad-spectrum coverage and stability. Getz adds, “Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are well-known ingredients as mineral filters in Japanese mineral sunscreens.” According to Getz, one of the main reasons why Japanese sunscreens are highly popular is their unique texture. Japanese sunscreens are beloved for their non-greasy, non-sticky lightweight texture that absorbs quickly. “In the hot and humid summers of Japan, we tend to prefer products with a light texture,” she explains. “Many people also use sunscreens before applying makeup, so we appreciate sunscreens with a serum or primer-like performance and texture.” 60+ of the Beauty Products in Vogue’s Summer Beauty Shop 6 At-Home Laser Hair Removal Devices, According to Experts These Are the Best Tinted Moisturizers for Lightweight Coverage and Sun Protection 14 Best Body Oils for Soft, Supple Skin and a Touch of Shine The Best Sunscreen for Face Recommended for Year-Round Protection How to Treat & Tame Flyaway Hairs This Summer 12 Lip Stains for Transfer-Proof, Long-Lasting Color The Best Bronzing Drops Give Skin a Sun-Kissed Glow 11 Summer Fragrances That Are an Escape in a Bottle By signing up you agree to our User Agreement (including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Vogue.

One that means you’re under constant pressure to be perfect, to overachieve and to please everyone at once, even when you’re completely overwhelmed. Sound familiar? Then, like me, you might have eldest-daughter syndrome; congratulations on losing the birth-order lottery! It might not be an official medical condition, but “eldest=daughter syndrome” is the term we oldest siblings have been searching for our whole lives to describe the expectations and pressures we felt growing up—and still do. Social media is rife with women comparing notes (of course we take them, we’re eldest daughters) and complaining about how we deserve financial compensation. “Being an eldest daughter is like an unpaid internship for the rest of your life,” wrote one on X. Or, as another woman put it, “Are u OK or are u the eldest daughter?” I have two younger sisters who are also twins, yet I still can’t get a diagnosis. No fair. There are four years between us, which means nothing now, but growing up it seemed like a huge gap. When I was drinking my first Alcopops and going on dates, they were still playing with dolls. I didn’t feel like a second mother, as some eldest daughters do, but there was a responsibility there: to set an example, blaze a trail, and be a role model. I was acutely aware that my parents tended to be stricter with me. There was an expectation that I would focus on my studies and not give in to distractions, whereas my younger sisters were allowed to get part-time jobs if they so wished. There was a sense that my role was to excel at school, get impressive grades, and go to a good university–for myself, of course, but also to motivate my sisters to follow in my footsteps. Put simply, as an eldest daughter, you’re held to higher standards than your younger siblings, and then you wonder why, in adult life, you can’t let go of the need to be “perfect” all the time. You have ambition and drive, but are never satisfied with what you achieve. You struggle to enjoy what you already have. You’re extremely diligent but rarely feel rewarded for it. You try to control situations before they’ve even started to go downhill. Now, try being an eldest daughter and a Capricorn: see my problem? Of course, not every eldest daughter feels this way. But the good news, for those of us who do, is that science might be starting to back us up. A new study by the University of California, Los Angeles has found that some eldest daughters (those born to mothers who experienced stress during pregnancy) mature more quickly and take on a greater caregiving role within the family. It would be easy to blame my parents, but I don’t think for a second that my mum and dad meant to pile on excessive pressure. It’s just that, as their firstborn, I was their entire focus—the child into whom they poured their hopes and dreams—before the others come along. A pattern had been set and it was hard to break. Besides, my parents really just wanted me to reach my potential and do my best; I was the one who ran with it and couldn’t let go. Many eldest daughters complain that their birth position meant their childhood was essentially “stolen” from them. I don’t feel that way, but I do think all that expectation can rob you of the chance to find out who you really are. Acting out the wishes of your parents for so long doesn’t exactly leave much room for your personality to bloom. I was probably well into my 20s, arguably my 30s, before I began to emerge from my chrysalis and work out who I actually wanted to be. If this all sounds like I’m resentful of my sisters, I’m not—but from where I’m sitting, their lives have looked a lot more relaxing. By the time they were teenagers, no one really minded that they stayed out late or what they studied at university. I don’t recall them ever being grounded for coming home inebriated, whereas I was once kept indoors for a month after being sick in my mother’s rose bushes (good fertilizer, I’m sure). I wouldn’t have dared get a rebellious tattoo or belly-button piercing, as they did, but instead waited patiently until the age of 15, when my mum agreed to take me to have my ears pierced—under supervision, at the local pharmacy, only if I was a good girl. She now admits that it was easier just to give into my sisters in exchange for a more peaceful life. Who wouldn’t do the same? I do also wonder if our younger siblings feel disenfranchised by us eldest sisters, always claiming the role of family mediator, organizer, and spokesperson. I have to actively make an effort to allow my sisters to book restaurant tables or organize joint birthday gifts, something that doesn’t come easily and goes against my ingrained eldest-sister instinct. Once that responsibility has been put on your shoulders, it’s hard to hand it over to anyone else. Maybe they’d claim that our parents weren’t focused on them enough? Plus, the uncomfortable truth is that part of me loved it. Still does. Being called a “good girl”? Being praised for being a “big help” and “no trouble”? I like hearing those things, even if they come with a side order of pressure to maintain that behavior. My husband always jokes that I’m tenacious—bordering on obsessive—when it comes to tracking down tickets for gigs or plays we want to see, but it’s really just my eldest-daughter syndrome. I find it hard to fail and hate giving up. And I’m sure it’s not a coincidence that many of my friends are eldest daughters, too. We sufferers have to stick together.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Throughout the history of the Games, the best Olympic uniforms have always reflected the era’s zeitgeist. After all, what Olympic athletes wear to compete is essential—both to their performance and to their legacy—so their uniforms must balance practicality and innovation while also exuding national pride and identity. With the help of major designers and brands—Ralph Lauren, Levi Strauss, Christian Louboutin, Georgio Armani, Halston, and more—the most memorable Olympic uniforms have managed to seamlessly accomplish all of the above. Of course, sports and fashion have a long, intertwined history. Michael Jordan’s signature jump shot was stamped on the back of every Nike Air Jordan; Tennis champion René Lacoste created Lacoste’s iconic polo shirt; the pleated tennis skirts of Wimbledon are said to have inspired the signature flapper look of the 1920s. Now, with the Olympic Games in Paris fast approaching, there’s a whole new opportunity to witness that intersection for an entirely new time. Ahead of what is sure to be an inspiring and memorable Paris 2024—both in terms of style and athletic feats—here is a look back at some of the best Olympic uniforms of all time, as seen at the opening ceremonies, on the field, and every Olympic event in between. The royal blue warm-up suits worn by the US Women’s Gymnastic Team at the 1960’s Olympics were simple, yet powerful. With red and white piping details down the sides, these tracksuits nod to the era’s fascination with astronaunts and space. While not specifically created for Mexico’s athletes, the psychedelic uniforms designed by Irma Dubost and Julie Murdoch for the guides at Mexico City’s Summer 1968 Games are definitely worth a second look: a high-neck minidress with a sleeveless cape in a swirling print. The look feels perfectly in line in the mod movement of the time. For the 1976 Winter Olympics in Colorado Springs, the figure skaters of Team USA wore red leisure suits during their downtime featuring a very seventies silhouette featuring high necks, flared hems, and red-white-and-blue star trim. The red tank top and blue shorts worn by Team USA long jumper Martha Watson call to mind the ensemble of another superstar: Wonder Woman, as played by Lynda Carter in the TV series that debuted the same year. The sparkly flame design on Miwako Motoyoshi and Saeko Kimura’s white swimsuits—which featured a deep neckline—were quintessentially 1980s and are burned into many synchronized swimming fans’ memories. Their elegant performance at the Summer 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles earned them the bronze medal. Florence Griffith Joyner was known for her speed—and her fierce personal style. In the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, she broke the Olympic record for the 100-meter dash wearing a hooded running suit complemented by red lipstick and her signature extra-long nails (painted patriotic red, white, and blue with gold accents in honor of the medal she was after). Her good luck nails worked: she actually ended up taking home three gold medals that year. Team Canada took a more-is-more approach for the opening ceremony of the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary; both female and male athletes marched in bright red trench-style coats trimmed with white fringe and topped with white cowboy hats—Calgary is known as “Cow Town”, after all. In 1996, all eyes were on the USA Women's Gynmastic’s Team, which was known as the Magnificent Seven. The team—which included Kerri Strug, Dominique Moceanu, Shannon Miller, Amy Chow, Amanda Borden, Jaycie Phelps, and Dominique Dawes (pictured above)—would go on to win the United States’ first-ever team gold medal in the sport wearing now-iconic white leotards emblazoned with a large stars-and-stripes motif and scrunchies. Russia’s Olympic synchronized swimming team stunned at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece—and not just because of their gold-winning performance. Their uniforms featured neon flower patterns on a sparkly neutral background that matched their skin so perfectly it appeared nearly sheer. The athletes of Team India were elegant at the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Games in coordinating canary yellow sarees and Rajasthani pagris. Their march was famously interrupted by a crasher who ran from the stands to walk with them, but it was their striking uniforms that truly stole the show. The eye-catching yellow ensembles worn at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony were designed by Cadella Marley, daughter of Bob Marley. While opening ceremony uniforms are usually matching, Marley opted to design a slew of different pieces ranging from blazers to mini-skirts to ornate scarves that the athletes could mix and match. Men’s 100m and 200m champion Usain Bolt led the charge carrying his country’s flag wearing bold yellow pants. Mexico’s alpine ski team wore black snowsuits adorned with intricate sugar skulls, a nod to their country’s well-known Day of the Dead tradition. The suits were designed for the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics by alpine ski team leader Sarah Schleper, who is pictured wearing the uniform alongside teammate Rodolfo Dickson. For the opening ceremony for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics—which actually took place in 2021, thanks to Covid-19 pandemic—the delegate from Kenya wore violet and red gingham dresses with billowing capes and strappy sandals. The look was created by Wanja Ngare, a Kenyan designer known for using prints, textiles, and silhouettes inspired by her Massai culture. Team China’s American-born freestyle skier Eileen Gu became the breakout star of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The 18-year-old was the first women to win the gold metal in the sport—and also won plenty of accolades worldwide for her sleek style and eye-catching headwear.

Cool and crisp, the boxer shorts trend seems to get a reboot every few seasons. One might say it peaked last summer, when cotton poplin styles were ubiquitous in TikTok outfit diaries thanks to their inherent gender-neutral appeal that allows for diverse styling that could pass as both high-fashion and street-friendly. Vogue has been tracking the menswear-inspired look since 2022, when Miu Miu sent shorts and miniskirts down the runway with exposed underwear peeking out from ultra-low waistbands reminiscent of aughts fashion. Bottega Veneta and The Row brought their own vision for how to wear the trend during their fall and pre-fall 2023 collections, respectively: with a matching shirt only half-buttoned to show a flash of skin (and the elastic waistband) with a structured blazer and leather flip-flops for an Olsen twin-approved business casual look. Bella Hadid, Alexa Chung, and Kendall Jenner were early adopters, followed more recently by Zendaya, who gave it a preppy spin by pairing her blue pinstripe boxers with a relaxed button-up and pointy pumps during her Challengers promotion tour. The boxer short trend remains relevant right now—GQ recently declared “men’s boxers as one of biggest menswear trends in women’s fashion,” though one could argue there’s no better time to give the underwear-as-outerwear look a try than right now. Peak warm weather calls for the least amount of clothing possible, and cotton poplin shorts are a functional wardrobe staple that offers just enough coverage to stay cool with a hint of cheeky style. Below, we’ve mapped out seven ways to help you bring the look to life this summer: you can make it feel romantic, fashion-forward, sporty, beachy, preppy, or just downright easy—the beauty of the boxer short trend is its fluidity, after all. Zara’s dainty blouse adds feminine charm to blue pinstripe boxer shorts.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. In the very first seconds of Laura Marling’s upcoming album, we hear the rustle of distant footsteps. Then comes Marling’s own voice, chatting to someone in her studio, before a folksy strum of acoustic guitar announces the beginning of the track. There’s the giggle of an infant, followed by Marling’s own laughter, as she launches into “Child of Mine,” a devastatingly beautiful portrait of the very specific experience of becoming a parent during the pandemic that, in Marling’s hands, is deftly transformed into a universal tale of the tumultuous bond between parent and child. (Everyone in the world can relate to that.) It’s a neat introduction to Marling’s new record, Patterns in Repeat, which charts the emotional topography of becoming a mother—from the highs of postpartum euphoria, to the gradual dawning of how drastically her life had changed, to the deeper philosophical questions it prompted around her own childhood, and balancing her newfound double duties as a mother and an artist. The record was made almost entirely at her home studio in east London, with Marling’s baby daughter bouncing on her knee or crawling at her feet. “You can hear this whole other incidental story happening behind, and the mistakes are left in, but that’s all stuff I like when recording anyway,” she says, breezily. “I’ve never done more than three or four takes of one thing, because I think you then start performing in a different way. It’s all part of my preference as an artist—to not be too precious.” More startling, perhaps, is that it’s also the eighth album from the 34-year-old musician, who burst onto the British music scene back in 2008 as a teenager, and has barely paused to take a breath since. Patterns in Repeat comes four years after her last release, the prophetically titled Song for Our Daughter, and while the gap can in part be explained by practical concerns—the pandemic, parenthood—it also represented a slowing-down that Marling attributes to getting (relatively) older. Marling’s music has always felt accomplished beyond her years, so it only makes sense that while the new record feels mature, it’s in more unexpected ways—like the dashes of wry humor sprinkled throughout, or the more freeform structure. On “Caroline,” for example, over a rippling guitar line, she descends into “la la las” and “something somethings,” appearing to lose her lyrical thread. Of course, Marling is never truly losing her lyrical thread. On Patterns in Repeat, her masterful ability to explore the nuances of friendship, family, love, and loss—and then distill these complex, sweeping ideas into a tidy string of words—is as present as ever. Not least on the album’s gorgeous debut single, “Patterns,” released earlier this week, which touches on understanding, with a profound new clarity, the sacrifices made by her parents during her own childhood. (“And as those years go by they'll look upon you / Kindly like a friend / A pattern in repeat / And never ends,” she sings.) “I was high as fuck when I was giving birth,” says Marling, before laughing and clarifying that it was an entirely natural high of oxytocin. “I was, like, sending crazy text messages of joy. But then that wears off and you’re like, actually, now I have to deal with tiredness and chaos, and you hit the next level of the game. You realize you’ve got a huge responsibility for the rest of your life not to fuck it up, and it makes you think about in what ways things might have been fucked up for you or for your siblings. So it’s all of that. It’s something of a cliché, but that’s what it is, really.” Here, Marling tells Vogue about the unexpected joy of songwriting during early motherhood, how her masters degree in psychoanalysis shaped her new album, and why she’s taking a different approach to touring this time around. Vogue: It’s been four years since we heard from you. At the beginning of your career, you were releasing albums every year or two like clockwork. First off, do you think there is anything about you as a person or artist that made you so prolific? Laura Marling: Well, I like keeping busy. And I’m maybe not very good at relaxing, but obviously that’s something different. It’s a combination of that, and also the fact that I’m a bit older. I think in your teens and your 20s, you have a lot of emotional storms happening around you all the time. In your 20s, it becomes a bit slower, but more complex, and in a way more profound. It takes more time to decipher what it is that you are feeling or what’s happening to you. And as much as I’ve tried to deny over the years that what I do is biographical, it’s obvious to me now that it is—but in a very “with a pinch of salt” way. I’m sure there were some practical reasons as to why this one took a little longer, also, with the pandemic and having your daughter. Yeah. Song for Our Daughter, the album before, was also four years after the previous record, but that was very much for practical reasons. I left my management company and I had to do all kinds of very boring bureaucratic stuff in order to get back in the studio. With this one, when my daughter was born and I started writing again, I was like, I am going to make an album this year. I booked two weeks of help from my family and friends—I was recording at home, but just to have people baby-wrangling. I thought it would only take two weeks, because that’s as long as it’s ever taken me to record an album, and then it took nine months to make, which was infuriating because I’ve never had to sit with my own voice for nine months, over and over. So I had a lot of... not self-doubt, but I had a lot of time to mull over it all in a way that wasn’t always very helpful. Anyway, we did it. We got it done. What was it actually like recording the album at home? Was that out of necessity or was it an attempt to try and cultivate a different kind of atmosphere on the record? I did most of Song for Our Daughter at home as well. I actually moved into a house just before the pandemic that had a studio in the basement that was built by the previous owner. That’s very handy. It’s so fucking handy, because I wouldn’t know how to start building a studio. It’s not in my feminine skillset. [Laughs.] So that was good. What that experience revealed to me was that it's actually really good to have no other input until you’re absolutely sure what you want, so that you can dictate exactly what you want. Making an album is, in its nature, a collaborative process, so you have to find a way to get what you want done without upsetting other people’s very worthy input. And that was much heightened by having a baby and having the restrictions of not being able to leave the house, really. And I enjoyed those restrictions, like having to put her on the floor when I was recording. This is when she was very little, so she couldn’t move around. So there’s a lot of incidental noise on the record of babbling babies and dogs shaking their collar and things like that. It was relatively simple, and the outcome is relatively simple. You said the sound of your own voice started to drive you crazy. Did that extra time fine-tuning the album, without worrying about the costs of renting a studio, end up feeling like a challenge or a blessing? I think it gave me a lot of time to think about what the point of making an album is these days. I did say to myself—I didn’t say it in any public way—but I said to myself after the last album that there’s no constraint on what length an album could be now that people don't predominantly make records for vinyl. I know that vinyl is hip or whatever, but it’s a bit of tat now, as far as I’m concerned. And so why wouldn’t you just write a bunch of songs that have a dramatic arc that's interesting, and just put it out there? Which is what lots of young artists are doing anyway; they release EPs or a crop of songs at a time, and I think that’s really cool. Other than that, I actually wouldn’t want to do it like this again—I wouldn’t want to sit with them so long. You get bored of the songs as well, and then you’ve got to go through the whole fucking process talking about them for another six months. And then perform them forever, presumably. Yeah, then performing them forever. But I’ve had a nice break actually since we finished in... Oh, my God, I don’t remember. We finished in March, so I haven’t listened to it since then. I wouldn’t want to have that protracted a process again though. It sounds to me more like the process of writing a novel than recording an album—at least in terms of being in the weeds with every detail of it for so long. Yeah, actually, funnily enough, I was thinking about that this week because the one thing I really did love about it was the solitary nature of it. I started a Substack a couple of weeks ago, and it means that when my baby was very young, in the evenings my partner would put her to bed and then I’d do the recording until midnight, and now in the evenings I prepare in advance for Substacks that are going to come out in a few weeks. And I love that concerted solitary writing time. I’m sure that’s something you can relate to also. So I’m glad. Maybe that’s a good thing for me. I know that you completed your masters in psychoanalysis just before beginning the writing process. Did that feed into the final form of the album in any way? I handed in my thesis maybe a month before I gave birth, and then I went to the graduation after she was born. It was actually a super painful process, because I only got GCSEs, so I went straight from GCSEs to a masters, and I’d never written like that at all. But it was good practice for me. And I should be careful what I say about it, but I did find psychoanalysis to be like a beautiful joke—it’s a ridiculous subject, and completely antiquated, and full of glaring, problematic errors. But it’s also an amazing extractive tool for making music, because it’s really about investigating the poetic nature of the unconscious—and that’s all it’s really good for, in my opinion. So its emphasis on reading between the lines I really enjoy, and I really enjoy that also in songwriting and poetry and novels, so I was thinking about it when I was writing. Did it change how you watch a film or listen to an album or read a book? As in, did it alter your brain chemistry when it came to consuming culture, as well as making it? Look, I am truly basic. I don’t mean that in a “pick me” kind of way, but I only watch three things: The Sopranos, Frasier, and Seinfeld. Oh, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. But I watch them over and over and over again, and I think all of life’s great peaks and troughs can be found in those TV shows. So I’m a big TV person. I used to be a film person, but I just literally don’t have time these days. I do love reading though, and I especially love reading someone else’s film review without having seen the film. I have a friend who’s incredibly clever and I live for her telling me the plots of films that she’s seen and never seeing the film [myself]. I still get a lot out of it in that way, but not directly. I’m like a mosquito sucking the blood out of other people’s intelligence in that regard. [Laughs.] But it does feed into my songwriting. Thinking about this idea of “patterns in repeat,” across the album there are lyrics that touch on your experiences of becoming a parent, and how that led you to thinking about your relationship with your own parents, and the traits that are passed on from generation to generation. But the intimacy of it and the ambient noises from your house that are threaded through also made me think about the daily patterns you repeat as a new parent, which are often sort of… Banal? I’m sure they’re often banal or mundane, but also very beautiful and profound in their own way, too? Were those patterns you were thinking about when making the record? Yes, I was thinking about that. And I was also thinking about my parents, and parents in general. I’ve always had this desperate want to understand the internal workings of my parents’ desires and wants for life and what they actually wanted and whether it matched up to what they hoped. I love my parents and I have a very good relationship with them, but we lived in Reading and my dad commuted to London every day and back. And maybe that’s not what he hoped for, to sit on a train for an hour and a half every day each way. But I find the banality of the domestic sphere really interesting. I guess that’s a very psychoanalytical thing: trying to imagine all of these people who live under this one roof and all of their desires and wants and where their internal worlds are, and how they meet maybe once a day at a dinner table. That also becomes very apparent when your relationship changes after you have a baby. I found the change in relationship after having a baby amazing and really wonderful, by the way. But it’s very different, because you now both have your own internal worlds, and you’re sharing this thing that needs all of your attention. And so, again, you understand, Oh, my God, that’s what was going on in my household growing up! There were these two people who had their own desires, but who had very limited time to express that in any direction. Tell me a little more about your decision not to tour the record in a more traditional sense. Was there anything specific that inspired you to do the parent-child shows? I obviously have the great honor and privilege of knowing a lot of musicians, and when my daughter was really little, if anybody was in town in London, I’d message them and ask if I could come along with her and watch the soundcheck, and it was amazing. The first one we did was with Buck Meek from Big Thief for his solo show, and he had a record out that was the soundtrack to our first couple of days with her, so that was incredibly special. I just thought: I know people open up their soundcheck sometimes for paying customers, so why not do a matinee where parents and children can come? They’re going to be very relaxed and probably chaotic events, but I hope that more people do it, because I don’t really go out in the evenings anymore, but I’d still love to go to gigs. It’s brilliant that you’re able to do it on your own terms like that. There’s so much pressure on musicians to promote records in a very prescribed way. Do you hope that it can provide an example for others as well? I do, although there are some caveats to that. One is that I’ve been doing it for so long that I have enough financial stability to do it this way, which is a huge privilege, of course. But also, I don’t have a lot of ambition. If I wanted to be a bigger artist, I obviously would have to tour a lot more. But I don’t have a lot of ambition, so I guess I’m lucky in that way. [Laughs.] It’s kind of boring, but there’s a huge financial complexity to choosing not to tour, which is why I’ve started a Substack— but it’s great, I love it. Really, the privilege of having started so young has turned out to be that I’m able to dictate what I want to do now. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " 'Find anything you save across the site in your account  A throng of stars from stage and screen gathered last night at New York’s Lyceum Theatre to celebrate the Broadway premiere of Oh, Mary!, the play written by and starring Cole Escola as Mary Todd Lincoln, reimagined here as an alcoholic wannabe cabaret performer. The sweltering 91-degree heat did not keep the play’s legion of boldface fans from paying homage to this deliciously ahistorical (and critically acclaimed) first-lady farce. With the tumult of Times Square as a backdrop, Ruth Negga braved the temperatures in a knit dress, with Escola’s friend and frequent collaborator Amy Sedaris just behind her. Rebecca Hall and Morgan Spector gamely posed with an Oh, Mary! frame while Spector’s Gilded Age costar Ben Ahlers walked the carpet (no season-three spoilers from either). Kaia Gerber continued to rep hot brunette summer as she and Austin Butler ducked in just before curtain. (Among the other guests were Patti LuPone, Molly Ringwald, Maude Apatow, Kara Young, and Matthew Broderick.) Oh, Mary!’s star and creator opted for a slinky, black corset gown by CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist Jackson Wiederhoeft, channeling so much John Singer Sargent’s Madame X. “I feel crazy,” Escola said before heading into the theater to transform into Mary, dodging fans lined up for selfies. “It’s like a birthday and Christmas and first date all together.” Cole Escola during the curtain call for Oh, Mary! at the Lyceum Theatre on Thursday night. Inside the Lyceum, preshow music appropriately alternated between Ethel Merman’s disco album and Liza Minnelli’s 1980s collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys. As the curtain came up, there was little doubt that Escola and company would continue the streak they have been on since opening downtown at the Lucille Lortel this past winter. Escola’s acrobatic pratfalls and pitch-perfect timing remain unchanged from the show’s off-Broaday run, though the sets have been noticeably dolled up since the transfer. Earlier this week, on The Run-Through With Vogue, Escola expressed worry that the show may be “overstaying our welcome,” but judging from the rapturous applause after the swift 80-minute run time, they had nothing to fear. After a short speech (“I really want to make this quick because we all want to get to The Eagle”), with thank-yous to director Sam Pinkleton (dressed last night in Thom Browne), the cast and friends headed to the storied gay leather bar in west Chelsea, where among the crowd of friends and admirers were comedians Bridget Everett and Julio Torres. For Escola’s Eagle debut—they had never been to the club before—the star and their stylist, David Moses, went with a white feathered minidress from Wiederhoeft’s fall 2024 collection and pearls by Presley Oldham, a delightful contrast to the club’s dark and delightfully seedy ambiance. Posters of Escola as Mary, looking dour and severe, hung throughout the three-story space amidst chaps and other leather accoutrements available for sale. Partygoers nibbled on passed ice cream cones and smoked cigarettes on a packed roof deck while Sylvester’s “You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)” played on the dance floor below. Whispers of glee could be heard as the official reviews started trickling in around midnight—but other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the slay? Oh, Mary! runs until September 15.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Let’s be honest: It’s been a strange Wimbledon, filled with last-minute absences; even later-minute sudden injuries, retirements, and walkovers; and a host of upsets. Nobody, but nobody, predicted this women’s final, which pits 31st-seeded Czechian doubles specialist Barbora Krejčíkova against the seventh-seeded Jasmine Paolini of Italy. (They play at 9 a.m. ET tomorrow.) Whoever wins, we will see—for the eighth straight year—a new Wimbledon women’s singles champion. For Paolini, it’s been the summer of her career, if not her life. Before last month, she hadn’t won a single match on grass, and here she is, playing for the Wimbledon title. She also reached the final at the French Open mere weeks ago, and while Paolini lost that match, against Iga Swiatek, quite badly, the experience of playing on the sport’s biggest stage should be a great boon to her here—as should her gutsy, thrilling, come-from-behind semifinal victory over Donna Vekić in a third-set tiebreak. (When a reporter asked her yesterday what she’d say if someone told her a year ago that she’d reach both the French and Wimbledon finals in 2024, Paolini responded: “You are crazy, I would say.” Indeed, she is the first woman to manage that feat since Serena Williams did it in 2016.) Krejčíkova already has a major singles title under her belt—she won the French in 2021—along with 10 major doubles titles, and was ranked as high as second in the world in recent years before she was beset by a series of arm, elbow, and wrist injuries. If there were any doubts about her match readiness, though, they were answered early on at Wimbledon, with her impressive victories over Danielle Collins, Jelena Ostapenko, and especially fourth-seeded Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, in the semifinals. Barbora Krejčíkova hits a return during her semifinal match against Elena Rybakina on Thursday. So who’s going to win? Truly anybody’s guess. Though both players are the same age (28), Krejčíkova has an edge when it comes to high-pressure experience. Both players have a similar game—strong, aggressive groundstrokes—so this could be an intense fistfight from the baselines, but then again, both also embrace net play. Edge to Krejčíkova here: The speed and pace of her forehand and backhand are a bit beyond what the compact Paolini is capable of wielding, and her doubles background will be invaluable at the net. What does Paolini bring to the table? She’s faster to the ball—which, on Wimbledon grass, is a lot. She’s been on-point with her service return, which will be key. And, perhaps most importantly (if intangibly), Paolini seems to be riding a wave. She’s charismatic, and the crowd loves her. That’s not everything—but it’s a lot. As for the men: While the bill of Carlos Alcaraz vs. Novak Djokovic on Sunday at 9 a.m. ET is a far more familiar—and expected—one on paper, it’s no less unpredictable. While Alcaraz has looked, at times, far from perfect en route to the final—he needed five sets to get past Frances Tiafoe in the third round, and four to beat Tommy Paul, Ugo Humbert, and Daniil Medvedev in ensuing rounds—his path to the final has also, even in the midst of all that, seemed somehow inevitable, almost trademarked. Think killer speed, highlight-reel angles, and that relentless focus, coupled with a Nadal-like inability to concede, even when the end seems to be nigh. Carlos Alcaraz, after his semifinal match against Daniil Medvedev on Friday. Djokovic, meanwhile, maybe shouldn’t even be here after his knee surgery a few weeks ago—but he’s enjoyed a relatively easy path to the finals and is coming off a well-fought but (in Novak World) assured straight-sets victory over Lorenzo Musetti to get here. The only wobbles in his Lazarus-like return to greatness at Wimbledon have involved his interactions with the crowd. For a player of his greatness, he’s long had combative relationships with his audiences, and this tournament has been no exception, with the crowd occasionally seeming to root against him—and Djokovic responding by pretending to play his racquet as a violin, only egging them on further. Novak Djokovic, teasing the crowd during this semifinal match against Lorenzo Musetti on Friday. In the final, though, expect those antics to cease: Handling Alcaraz will be all-hands-on-deck challenge. Obviously, Djokovic brings literally decades of experience as arguably the greatest player ever to the table, while Alcaraz is out of central casting as his heir apparent. (No less than Djokovic himself called Alcaraz “for sure the greatest 21-year-old in the history of this sport” after his semifinal win.) If Djokovic has been tested less so far in the tournament, that works both ways: He’s at once better-rested and, perhaps, not quite as battle-hardened as Alcaraz may be. This final has the potential to be an historic battle royal and, perhaps again, a passing of the torch—Djokovic, of course, has won this trophy seven times, while Alcaraz is the defending champion. Here’s hoping we’re in for one to remember.

Before diving head-first into her family’s rosé and winery business, Wölffer enjoyed a career in jewelry design, creating pieces for Jones Apparel Group and then for the now-defunct but absolutely brilliant concept Styleliner—launched in 2010, Wölffer converted a potato chip delivery truck into a mobile pop-up shop that sold clothing and jewelry she designed. “Reed was always my hero—so it was really cool when we got on our first call for this collection, and I was telling Reed what I liked and didn\\'t like,\" she explained, adding how much she had admired Krakoff and his incredible design sensibilities for years. \"It was an oh-my-gosh-moment! It was such a dream to do this collection.” The collection includes seven pieces that are as colorful as Wölffer’s Summer in a Bottle wine offerings. They are crafted from an assortment of reclaimed sterling silver, rosey-hued beads, mother of pearl, rhodonite, and glossy enamel. The peg? (Because there’s always a peg!) The jewelry collection celebrates ten years of Wölffer’s Summer in a Bottle, with 20% of proceeds being donated to the Parrish Art Museum. Back to that view, it belonged to Krakoff, who welcomed guests at his beachfront Amagansett home—a gleaming modern masterpiece of polished concrete and clean lines by architect Thomas Phifer and Partners—situated in the dunes of the Atlantic Ocean. The expansive deck, where dinner was hosted and enjoyed by an accomplished collection of guests like Katie Couric, Elizabeth Saltzman, Erik Torstensson, Fern Mallis, and Trey Laird and Krakoff’s wife Delphine and daughter Lily. “We’ve had a great time working together,” said Krakoff to his guests before they sat for a dinner of summer heirloom tomatoes with burrata and steak filets. “These kinds of projects are always great to do, but when they\\'re enjoyable and easy, that\\'s really the way they should be.” As Krakoff and Wölffer would reveal, the collaboration was a delightfully unfussy and harmonious one. (Along the way, they learned they had even gone to the same high school.) It was as natural to do as, say, opening up another bottle of rosé. “And to something that benefits the Parrish Art Museum, which we\\'re all big fans of, just made this that much better.” Products are independently selected by our editors.

              " 'Find anything you save across the site in your account  Asiah James and Gerald Cannon met in 2014, while both were working at a Topshop in New York City’s Soho neighborhood. Amid the crowded aisles and clothing racks, they discussed everything from style, jazz, and art, to their mutual obsession with dating shows—falling in love themselves in the process. Eight years later, Asiah (now a strategy director at Condé Nast) and Gerald (a visual artist) got engaged in her hometown of Washington, D.C. After spending the day together at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Gerald proposed in their hotel room. “He said so many sweet things I cannot remember because I was in shock, crying happy tears for hours and FaceTiming all of our loved ones across the country,” says Asiah. When they returned to New York—on the day of their anniversary—their close friends surprised them with an engagement party. They decided to wed in Mexico City, a place where both have found creative inspiration over the years. “The city’s blend of allure and artistry has become an integral part of our lives,” the bride says. The couple asked Lupita Tirado and Joe Ganem of Lupita Tirado Weddings to help plan their nuptials. On April 13, Asiah and Gerald held a welcome party at Casa Pedregal and Tetetlán restaurant, two Luis Barragán–designed properties on the outskirts of the city. The bride wore a custom chandelier crystal-drenched corset and matching miniskirt by Wiederhoeft, which she paired with satin Miu Miu pumps. She also debuted a new hairstyle: “My longtime friend and hairstylist, Amanda Charlery, had the idea when I got engaged to Gerald: She thought it would be fun to switch my hairstyle drastically throughout the wedding journey,” says Asiah. “A few months before my wedding weekend, we decided to grow my hair just enough for her to add extensions to create a blunt bob cut, which was so flirty and fitting for celebrating my pre-wedding events.” Meanwhile, the groom styled himself in Kiko Kostadinov trousers, a Fillipa K. Blazer, Prada lace-up monoliths, and accessories from Maison Margiela. After a cocktail hour by the pool at Casa Pedregal for 40 of their closest friends, the two joined the rest of their guests at Tetelán. The family-style dinner quickly turned into “the weekend’s biggest dance party,” says Asiah. The next day, they were married at General Prim, a historic belle epoque mansion in Colonia Juarez, in front of 165 family members and friends. The ceremony opened with their parents walking arm-in-arm down the aisle: IcyTwat and Robert Glasper played as the bride made her entrance in a custom corset gown from Wiederhoeft that took six months to perfect. “My wedding-day gown embodied my eclectic yet modern style,” she says. “I know it’s funny and super-nontraditional, but to me it was and remains so on brand for me as a bride.” Asiah also removed her extensions and cut her hair in a low bowl cut. For his ceremony outfit, Gerald opted for a Prada suit. Their close friend and officiant Shay Myrick shared quotes by historian Tiya Miles and poet Maya Angelou before asking the crowd to take a “pledge of presence,” or a promise to support the couple throughout their marriage. Asiah considered it the emotional pinnacle of the evening. “It was incredibly heartwarming and meaningful to witness and be a part of,” she says. Their first kiss was to Janet Jackson’s “That’s the Way Love Goes,” and after jumping over the broom—a wedding tradition with roots in the 18th century—they walked back up the aisle and out through ivy-covered doors. “Gerald and I both felt an overwhelming sense of calm and serenity throughout the ceremony—and have found ourselves reflecting on it every day since then,” says Asiah. For the reception, Asiah removed the tulle overskirt from her gown, revealing a miniskirt underneath. “It offered a high-low effect that allowed the gown to flow through the reception, and dance with ease for our first dance and dances with my parents,” she says of the wardrobe alteration. It proved a very smart style decision: From the moment that she and Gerald danced to a soulful rendition of Sade’s “I Couldn’t Love You More,” the party never stopped—even during the four-course meal. At one point, their wedding planners even surprised the couple with a performance from voguers, who led guests into the after-party space. “The atmosphere exuded the ambiance of a vibrant nightclub, featuring a special nod to my Washington, D.C., roots with a go-go segment that our DJ, Shabazz, lit up the dance floor with until 2 a.m.,” Asiah says. During the festivities, she snuck off with her closest friends to transform her dress yet again, stitching on silk tassels to create “a dance party-ready” skirt. “I also removed the straps so that I could really wiggle and hug everyone,” Asiah notes. Streamers, confetti, and fake money fell from the ceiling as night turned into morning. Three months later, Asiah and Gerald say they’re still in awe of the whole weekend: “As Gerald and I reflect on our wedding now that it’s concluded, we can confidently say it was the most extraordinary experience of our lives,” she says. “Already, we find ourselves joking about the possibility of a destination baby shower when the time comes—a testament to the joy and anticipation that fills our hearts for what lies ahead.” From the very start of our venue scavenger hunt, we prioritized uncovering spaces that capture the essence of Mexico City’s creativity that we adore and admire. Cue the excitement as we were blessed to kick off our welcome party with rehearsal cocktails at Casa Pedregal, a private home crafted by renowned architect Luis Barragán. The welcome-party theme was simple—bring the fun! And while this Wiederhoft chandelier-crystal-drenched corset and matching miniskirt were on my mood board from the moment it walked the runway, I initially thought I wanted to lengthen the skirt to hit the floor and wear it on the big day. Well, I fell in love with the mini, and here we are. So ready for the big day. But first, more time with my love during our rehearsal cocktail. Enter, our Inner Circle—our chosen family. We asked them to pull looks together that mimic their vibrant personalities. We were so in awe of the outcome. Our people look fly! More from Vogue See More Stories © 2024 Condé Nast.

The information we obtain generally consists of information (1) you give us about yourself, (2) you give us about others, (3) automatically collected about your interactions with the Magazine Services and our content or ads on third-party websites, apps or other media, and (4) we get from other sources. We may ask you to provide information about yourself when you use the Magazine Services. For example, to subscribe to one of our newsletters, you will need to give us an email address.

The information you give us may include details such as: You may give us information about other people, such as the name and email of a friend or contact with whom you want to share an article, the name and address of a gift subscription recipient, or if you participate in a survey or a research initiative. Do not give us information about others unless you are authorized or have their consent to do so. We will use their information for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. The Magazine Services automatically log certain information about visits to the Magazine Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the Magazine Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues.

The section below provides more information about these settings. DAA Industry\\xa0Opt-Out Some of the ads you see on the Magazine Services are targeted ads (this is also known as online behavioral advertising) described\\xa0in section C. 3 For advertising and marketing purposes, including targeted advertising. We describe below steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of targeted ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Magazine Services. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of targeted ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests. In addition, if you take the steps described below, some automated means may still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Magazine Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality). The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ. Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific. Website (Browser) Opt-Out Mobile App Opt-Out Please keep in mind that as the mobile environment continues to evolve, additional opt-out mechanisms or privacy settings may become available to you. We encourage you to review the information on opt-outs and settings that device manufacturers, technology companies and industry associations make available to you. Do Not Track/Global Privacy Control Hearst does not currently take steps to respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals as no uniform standard to respond to such signals has been developed at this time. We do, however, respond to the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to the extent required by applicable law, and allow eligible individuals to convey opt-out preferences when we detect the signal. You can learn more about the GPC on the Global Privacy Control website. Smart TVs, Streaming & Other Connected Devices For connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, please review the device’s settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking.\\xa0 Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like “limit ad tracking” or to disable options such as “targeted advertising,” “interactive TV,” or “smart interactivity”.\\xa0 These settings vary by device type. Additional Choices We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in your choice of the following locations: San Francisco, CA, Denver, CO, or New York, NY. The arbitrator's ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York City, New York. Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in New York City, New York. No failure or delay by Hearst in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed solely and exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA without giving effect to any law that would result in the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

              " \"The content creator and comedian—whose first Netflix special, We Ride at Dawn, is out now—didn’t mean to launch a stand-up career. She just couldn’t help herself.  Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. If Hannah Berner were to credit her career to any one individual—apart from herself—it might be the driver who hit her with a car during her senior year of college. “Not to brag, but, physically, I handled that car,” the comedian and podcaster tells me. “You should see the car!” It was a frigid pre-dawn morning at the University of Wisconsin, the 2013 Big Ten tennis tournament on the horizon. If Berner could pull off a strong performance, she hoped to go pro after graduation. Instead, as she stepped into a crosswalk on her way to practice, a car struck her from the side. “Long story short, I was thrown, and I had a really bad muscle contusion, [the doctors] called it,” Berner explains. “I’m not a woman in STEM,” she adds. “I don’t know what that means.” She’d avoided any broken bones, but her tennis career suffered post-recovery: She lost several matches in tiebreaks after she returned to the court, and it quickly became clear her Wimbledon dreams were slipping away. “At a young age, I had to break up with the longest relationship I’ve ever had, because it wasn’t working out anymore,” she says. “I felt like I was disappointing a lot of people. I felt like I was disappointing that young girl who wanted to be a champion, but I wish that girl knew how much happier she was going to be...I thought, in life, you had to be a masochist to accomplish incredible things, when you actually can just listen to your gut and make your gut happy. I know a lot of hot girls, we have gut problems, so it’s hard to listen to your gut, but it’s okay to do what seems like the easier path.” “Easier path” seems a bit of a misnomer, given where that path led: a role at the digital media company Betches (fun job, bad pay); a stint on the Bravo reality TV show Summer House (good visibility, brutal treatment); an astronomic rise as a comedian-interviewer-personality on TikTok (bigger audience, unpredictable results); and, finally, a comedy special on Netflix called We Ride at Dawn, which dropped on the streamer yesterday (incredible platform, but what if no one thinks you’re funny?). These risks and trade-offs have defined Berner’s post-college career—she’s now 32—as has her endearingly dare-me-to-do-it attitude. Five years ago, she says, there “wasn’t even the technology” for her to do the sort of work she does today, amassing her platform of more than 4 million followers across social platforms.  After her Summer House saga ended in 2021—a chapter that took an ugly pivot as she became a character fans loved to hate—Berner refused to disappear. She dug in her heels with comedy sets and podcasts and social media, where she set a goal for herself: For three months, she’d post on TikTok three times a day. She told herself, “‘I’m not going to judge. I’m just going to do it, and then after three months, let’s see where we’re at.’ It changed my life.” Over the ensuing years, her comedic man-on-the-street interviews about bedroom habits and “coochie shaving” led to her getting time with Jesse McCartney, the Jonas Brothers, and both Jennifers, Lopez and Lawrence. Her podcasts—particularly Giggly Squad, co-hosted with her Summer House castmate Paige DeSorbo—climbed the Spotify and Apple Podcasts charts. She married a “zaddy,” fellow comedian Des Bishop, in 2022 and wrote about it for this very site. She became not just popular but known.   Berner often repeats the sentiment that comedy “saved her life” once Summer House shaped her into someone she didn’t recognize. (Clashes with housemates, particularly her former friend Amanda Batula and Amanda’s now-husband, Kyle Cooke, earned her an unfavorable edit and audiences’ ire.) “After reality TV, I was feeling a little dirty,” she says. “I was feeling a little misunderstood; I was feeling confused.” She found refuge in onstage comedy sets: “The one time my mind was quiet, and I wasn’t on my phone, and at least I was on stage being judged for [being] authentically me and what I was putting out there.”  She’d first started meeting stand-up comedians pre-Summer House, while working as a video producer at Betches, where she hosted comedians in sketches. But stand-up didn’t become a legitimate practice of her own until 2019, when the success of her first podcast, Berning in Hell, earned her an invitation to try a live recording at the now-closed Carolines on Broadway. There, she incorporated a 10-minute stand-up set into the recording. She’d expected to feel the sense of foreboding that had loomed over her tennis matches, or the sort of scrutiny she’d picked up on Summer House. Instead, “when I was on stage, I felt like I was FaceTiming my best friend,” Berner says. “I think my sensitivity is what makes me good at standup but not good at reality TV.” Having sold tickets to live shows since early in her career, the Brooklyn-born Berner knew the next steps to take. As she road-tripped between clubs, she narrowed her enormous bucket of comedy content into a tight hour-long set. In 2022, she was named one of Just For Laughs’ New Faces of Comedy, and in 2023, Variety gave her a nod as one of its annual 10 Comics to Watch. “I was like, ‘Oh shit, I think I’m doing something right,’” Berner says.  By the time Netflix expressed interest in filming a special, it was her husband, Bishop, who told Berner she needed to take her time. He advised her to continue touring, perfect her material, and then give Netflix the go-ahead. “He basically was like, ‘Your first special, there’s no reason to rush into it,’” Berner says. “I actually had to be really patient when Netflix offered it to me, and I told them I wanted to wait an additional 10 months before I shot it. Netflix gave me the flexibility, like, ‘Okay, we can wait longer for you to make sure it’s the best it could be.’ But art is hard. Art’s never fully done.”  The special was at last taped in Philadelphia this March, featuring bits about Berner’s marriage to Bishop, unrealistic sex scenes in movies, Disney princes and Plan B, bachelorette parties as cults, and her “gun jokes” and “queef jokes,” which are her personal favorites. “I was feeling very calm and confident up until two weeks before the special [taping], and then I had a full-on mental breakdown,” Berner admits. She “called up the big guns,” including her therapist and the popular spiritual coach and motivational speaker Gabby Bernstein. “I fought my demons for two weeks, and then right before I stepped onstage, a calmness came over me,” she continues. “It was a crazy, intense emotional experience.”  Now, as We Ride at Dawn lands on Netflix, Berner’s already planning her next special. (She thinks she’ll tackle bits about tennis and her parents.) But she’s not abandoning any of her other projects in the meantime, particularly as Giggly Squad continues to perch high on the podcast charts and her TikTok interviews garner the attention (and participation) of Hailey Bieber and Charli XCX. She has no intentions to turn off the social media faucet; she enjoys making celebrities feel comfortable, making them laugh, even if she only gets five minutes to shove a mic under their chin. She’s even thrilled to talk strategy as our interview veers into theories about the dreaded algorithm. Her rules for Instagram? “Don’t post stuff to make someone jealous, unless it’s an ex. Don’t post something to try to make yourself look like something you’re not. Don’t edit your photos too much, or you’re going to hate yourself in real life.” For TikTok? “The first four seconds are really critical. Get into it, show them what you’re going to say, and then end with a really good hook.” For both? “Post every day. Once you find something that works, lean into it.” Most recently, she announced on Instagram that she and DeSorbo will publish a book in April of next year, How to Giggle, as a sort of self-help spin-off of the podcast. When Simon & Schuster first approached the women about a book project, they thought it was a joke. “We were like, ‘What about us made you think these girls are novelists?’” Berner says. But with some editing help from Berner’s mother, a former middle school teacher, they put together a collection sans ghostwriters. “How to take life less seriously is what the book’s about. We talk of everything from anxiety, to finding your personal style, to things that are difficult to do in bed. It really is a manifesto of our silliest personal thoughts.” Still, her stand-up journey remains, perhaps, the accomplishment of which Berner’s most proud—and which she’s most excited to continue pursuing. She brandishes her “nontraditional” path as a signal to other comics, primarily female-identifying ones, those who might not have explored stand-up previously “because, physically, it’s not always the safest place,” Berner says. “Going to bars or clubs at midnight in Brooklyn and then taking the subway at some point, you’re kind of like, ‘I don’t know if this is worth it.’”  Her unorthodox rise is no coincidence, she says, particularly as social media and podcasting allow creators to find an audience outside of the usual club circuit. “I hope women see the special and decide that there’s a safe space for women to go and watch comedy and love stand-up and feel like you’re out with the girls, and you’re not going to be uncomfortable,” Berner says. But, just as importantly, she hopes fans see a future for themselves: “You don’t need the traditional gatekeepers to tell you you’re funny [enough] to make it.”  House of the Dragon Season 2, Episode 5 Everything About the New Wuthering Heights Movie Who is Rachel Brosnahan's Husband Jason Ralph?

              " \"The burgeoning newsletter platform has become an unexpected social marketplace for vintage finds and high-ticket, in-demand items. Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. The way we shop secondhand has drastically changed over the years. Once upon a time, you had to pop into your favorite thrift store and rifle through racks of tossed-away garments to cherry-pick the good stuff. Fast forward to the late ’90s and early 2000s, and eBay paved the way for peer-to-peer platforms like Depop and Poshmark—as well as luxury consignment sites such as The RealReal. And over the pandemic, there was a big uptick in buying and selling directly on Instagram, which birthed a new wave of trust-based resale. But it’s more than just a flash in the pan—the tide change indicates an authentic shift in consumer behavior, as we see individuals prioritizing used clothing as a way to do better for the environment and their wallets. Resale reports continually share that not only are people turning to secondhand first, but even items that are “well-loved” are being snapped up, indicating that condition doesn’t play as big of a factor anymore either. And now, it seems there’s a surprising new option for secondhand shopping: Substack. The online platform’s popularity within the fashion space isn’t new. After all, we’ve seen former editors build devoted followings by acting as personal stylists—readers chime in on everything from vacation recommendations to what to wear for an upcoming wedding. But the buying and selling that’s happening here? It’s a thing.  “When I opened up Chat [where writers and creators have conversations with their subscribers], I had no idea it would become a space for buying and selling,” shares Gabriella Gofis of Gift of Gabs, whose threads are extremely active with resale listings. “One of the best success stories I’ve heard is one subscriber selling a Row Margaux bag to another subscriber,” she says. “I received a very kind message thanking me for the chat, because it led her to her dream purchase.” Christene Barberich, author of A Tiny Apt., echoes this interaction. “Pretty soon after I started A Tiny Apt., I began hosting ‘flash’ micro tag sales every few months, as well as vintage giveaways for paid subscribers where the first person to drop a comment gets it,” she shares. “I think a lot of people show up to score something great, but some just like to see what I have and what others are saying about these beautiful, rare, occasionally weird collectible things. It really has the potential to be a true social marketplace.” In a way, this turn of consumer events makes perfect sense: people have a direct line to an audience they know are avid shoppers, always on the hunt. Even if readers aren’t necessarily looking for the items being hawked, like many online purchases, impulse plays a big role. All of this coupled with the notion that these spaces are seen as Substack author-approved, you have a platform that’s ripe for buying and selling. “I think people have become more acclimated to trust-based interactions,” shares Harling Ross, the brains behind Gumshoe, a shopping newsletter with an emphasis on secondhand and one-of-a-kind items. “I haven’t introduced a Chat, yet but it’s something I do see myself doing in an intentional way.” “Selling these Prada leather T-strap sandals, size 7.5. They’re beautiful but too big—$60,” writes one user in Gift of Gabs’ Chat. In which a fellow subscriber quickly responds “Me!” “Selling a pair of Jamie Haller black loafers, worn once,” writes another user. Interactions like this are a constant in many of these forums—with dozens of new “listings”' a day, nestled between the sizing questions and the brand suggestions.  “I’ve always been a proponent of shopping secondhand,” shares Meg Strachan, founder and CEO of Dorsey and the publisher of  What I Put On Today. “I think my community has affinities for a lot of the same brands and the discussions evolved organically—from readers posting here and there to now actually selling items. It’s really taken off in the past six months.” “There is something about shopping in Substack that feels like being at a New York City sample sale,” adds writer and brand strategist Erika Veruink, who’s the author of the secondhand shopping-focused Substack Long Live. “Everyone’s chatting and there’s a community that wouldn’t make sense in any other context,” she says. And while not everyone has taken the plunge, they are indeed taking notice.“I haven’t made a resale purchase through the platform yet, but I’m always excited to see what surfaces whenever I check in,” shares Joyce Lee of Time Less.  While many find this burgeoning market appealing, for some authors and buyers alike, the lack of regulation is where it gets a bit dicey. “There is something about the nascence of it that feels so pure—which I love—but I do see a lot of chatter about how it’s not the place for reselling,” shares Sogole Kane, communications executive and writer of Another Fashion Newsletter. “I bought an Aesther Ekme bag off Substack not too long ago and I was so excited about it, but sadly the seller went back on it,” Kane shares. “She direct messaged me and said that someone else offered more, so she sent my money back.” The lack of oversight is a sore point for some authors, as well. “The buy-sell aspect was an interesting use of our Chat community, but it quickly got annoying,” shares Jess Graves of the popular Substack The Love List. “People would complain that sellers spam multiple channels with the same listings, and that the high volume made it hard to find the meaningful content.” Currently, it falls upon the author to regulate, which depending on preference is either welcomed or fully not.  “I had to step in and moderate the channel, establishing some rules,” Graves shares. “The most important being to only post items on the monthly resale thread, which organizes sale items into one easy-to-find space and keeps a clean house on our channel without eliminating sellers completely.” Strachan has a similar philosophy. “The flaw is that Substack isn’t currently built for transactions like this, and it can often become overwhelming. I’ve started jumping in to moderate.” Despite the infancy of Substack—particularly in regard to resale—many do see it as a new frontier for secondhand, including Substack itself. “People selling items via the chat feature has been fascinating to see,” shares Christina Loff, Substack’s head of lifestyle partnerships. “Substack is built on direct relationships and trust between publishers and their audiences. Publishers set the rules and curate the experience. Based on feedback, we recently introduced the ability for publishers to paywall their entire chats, making it available only to their most committed audience, paid subscribers,” she says. “Ultimately, our goal is to serve publishers’ needs and give them features to help grow and serve their communities.” Regardless of how resale on Substack continues to evolve, there’s one thing that most can agree on—and that’s the shared love for the platform. As Gafis puts it: “I really love that it is bringing people together in this way—it’s a true community, which is all I could have ever hoped for.” The Feminist Roots of the Chinese Qipao I Got Divorced, and Now I Hate All My Clothes Message on a Bottle Should I Stop Wearing My Ex’s Clothes?

              " 'I combed through the options, so you don’t have to.  Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. I have an abundance of bags—and not even designer ones. From backpacks and work totes to trendy summer purses, I always have options. Take it from me, then, that you can get some of the very best Amazon tote bags. That’s right—no trip to the mall necessary.  Totes truly run the gamut. What other style has the same range? I use totes to bring home groceries, attend office meetings, and even travel. Amazon offers everything from bulk options (which make great gifts for teachers), to personalized styles, and even luxury designers like Altuzarra and MCM. The number of reasons you could be browsing is endless, so I won’t try to guess. Here, keep reading for the 20 best tote bags on Amazon.  The beach is calling! And I think it’s telling you to bring this bag along...  Here’s a fresh take on the timeless black leather tote.   This portfolio tote is the epitome of understated elegance. It comes in nine versatile colors, so good luck picking just one.  This year, fashion saw the return of the slouchy hobo bag, and I’m not mad about it one bit.  Altuzarra is on Amazon; it’s a good day to be alive.  This tote is always in the running for the best laptop bag.   Customer review: “I needed a new Mary Poppins bag, and this one works wonders. The size is perfect, and it is super durable and comfortable to use. If there are any stains on the outside, they are easy to clean up with a wet wipe.” If canvas is too mainstream and leather isn’t your thing, how about corduroy?  Customer review: “This bag is an absolute gem! The material feels luxurious yet durable, ensuring it withstands daily wear. I adore its versatility...The ample compartments keep my essentials organized.” This bag is described as one for commuters, which is always a good sign in my opinion.  Customer review: “I love this purse...It is very sturdy. I don’t worry about the straps breaking at all, the quality is top tier. My mom is really into luxury bags she has multiple...I came to her house last week wearing this bag and she asked who was the designer!” Who doesn’t love a little Kate Spade?   Customer review: “Love the colorful print of this tote. It is lightweight and perfect for carrying small books. Straps are a great length, too. Nice tote for the money.” Did I just find my next work bag? Feels like yes.  Customer review: “This is a great travel bag. Fits perfectly as a personal item. Durable, stylish, and affordable!” Although Amazon doesn’t sell the original L.L. Bean Boat and Tote that we love so much, this version is just as great.  Customer review: “Wow, super impressed! The quality is so good! The zipper is great to have so items don’t fall out! If you’re looking for a washable, quality, large, easy on the go, and for many uses get this bag! Great for the pool, ballet bag, or teacher!” This bag comes in 17 colors, includes a matching pouch, and rings in under $70. That’s an A+ in my book.  Customer review: “This handbag is gorgeous and looks expensive even though it’s not! The vegan leather is a good quality and so soft. It holds quite a bit, too. I love the extra matching zippered pounce inside and the bottom support.” It’s all the in the label, folks.  Customer review: “I absolutely love this bag. It’s so cute and has lots of storage space. I would definitely recommend this bag if you want it.” It’s easy to fall into the habit of using whatever branded canvas totes might be floating around your house, but those can lack style. This black and white printed one, on the other hand, has style in spades.  Customer review: “Most use this bag for the beach but I use mine as a work bag. It’s exceptionally sturdy, has a beautiful lining, and durable. You won’t regret this purchase at such a great price.” Don’t underestimate the value of a zipper when it comes to a utility bag. This one is durable, washable, and so very functional.  Customer review: “I love the amount of pockets, water resistant material, size and practicality of this bag.” Where are my fellow book lovers? This makes for a sweet market, beach, or library tote.   Customer review: “I use this bag as my main tote/purse now, and it is insanely cute! Got a lot of compliments on it. It looks vintage. There’s one pocket inside that I use to hold small items and the zipper on the bag is wonderful if I need to close it.” Is it just me, or could this bag pass as designer?  Customer review: “Bought this bag for a beach vacation and I can see myself using it all summer for errands and running around. It stays clean and it’s so easy to find everything! Love the big pocket for keys and phone. I bought the tan color, but now am also eyeing the black because it’s so chic! Highly recommend.” I adore the quaint beach town vibe that a woven bag affords.  Customer review: “I’m going on a cruise and was looking for a beach bag that was lined. Found it! It’s large enough to hold a lot but not too big that it’s over the top. As I said lined, zipper closure and an inside pocket for perhaps keys or phone etc. Good quality. I’m very happy with the purchase.” This oversized, slouchy quilted style has become something of an It bag in the last year or so. At this price, you can’t beat it.  Customer review: “My daughter carries this everywhere. She gets tons of compliments and everyone mistakes it for the real thing.” All things cargo are in style at the moment. First it was pants, then shoes, and now, bags. I love when utility becomes trendy.  Customer review: “I love that it’s heavy-duty, a great neutral color in washable fabric, with thoughtful details like a key ring tab at the top so your keys don’t get eaten, two front pockets, a zip pocket in the interior and a big open pocket opposite that. The size is gratifyingly large, but its soft structure means you can put fit it in place a more structured tote wouldn’t fit. It holds everything quite nicely.” The 52 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon  15 Effortlessly Cool Platform Mules to Wear Now Kylie Jenner Takes Khy OOO  30 Linen Dresses That Feel Like Nothing The Launch: Fashion News to Know This July 16 Best Raffia Totes to Channel Summer Every Day ELLE Editors Share Their Prime Day Shopping Lists 18 Bermuda Shorts for an Effortlessly Chic Summer ELLE Editors Share Their Favorite Heels for Summer Sneak Peek: Our Nordstrom Anniversary Sale Picks These Fourth of July Furniture Sales Are Too Good 18 Designer Deals to Jump on This Holiday Weekend A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

              " \"From days in the sun to summer nights on the town, these are perfect. Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. We can all thank Jane Birken for giving straw bags a fashion platform in the 1960s. Her innovative style choice served as her go-to carryall for market runs and socialite events. She ignited a trend that reigns tried and true today. But what once exclusively came in the classic basket shape circa the Jane Birken era has emerged into a variety of shapes, styles, colors, and textures.  Raffia’s resurgence over the last few decades in the accessories world has been something to look forward to, come summer—and the most popular style comes in the tote silhouette. Versions of the straw tote bags are available at every major designer label, contemporary retailers, and even in the fast fashion world. This seasonal staple will elevate any warm-weather beach look, whether you’re actually hitting the sand to lay out or just dressing for the vibe. From vacation and resort wear to—like Birken—daily summertime errands, a straw tote is a stylish carry-all.   Ahead, we bring you our picks for the best straw tote bags of the season. Instead of dusting off whatever has been in summer storage, treat yourself to something new. From travel-friendly versions to colorful statement makers, there’s a style to suit every aesthetic and price point on the list ahead.  Ba&sh is the epitome of elevated boho, and this sunset, gradient print, braided tote follows suit. Plus, it’s just pretty to look at. With leather detailing and an outer pouch, it’s slouchy but structured, and super spacious to carry a towel, book, sunscreen, and more. It’s a vacation must. Colors: Pink, Brown, Multicolored Materials: Raffia, Leather If you’re looking for that summer straw tote vibe but can’t fully commit to the nature of it all, the Siena Tote from BTB Los Angeles is a happy medium. In metallic silver, it’s beach glam at its finest, perfect for any poolside hang. Colors: Silver Materials: Woven Metallic It’s not often you see raffia bags fully dyed with dramatic detailing, like this one with a frayed top from Sensi Studio. The saturated turquoise is meant to be carried along water that’s just as blue (Bora Bora, anyone?). It’s the perfect combo of spacious real estate, quality leather, and bold style in the spirit of summer. Materials: Raffia, Leather Colors: Turquoise/Light Blue Straw  Rouje is full of items that fall under the umbrella of French-girl chic. This bag feels like your classic basket style circa the Jane Birken era but with an update. The scalloped leather details and raffia flower add a playful feminine touch, while the elongated shape feels modern.  Materials: Raffia, Leather Colors: Natural Straw  The possibilities of straw bag designs are endless these days. Take this plaid, graphic, unexpected color combo from Kate Spade, for example. It’s the same Manhattan bag the brand’s customers know and love, with a fun summer update. It can fit a 13-inch laptop, a towel, and cosmetic bags, among other things. Materials: Straw with Leather Trim Colors: Caramel Corn Plaid, Pink Multi  Mini totes might only fit the essentials (phone, card case, lipstick) and nothing more, but they sure are cute. With beaded handles and trim, it’s more than just a bag; it’s a form of jewelry in its own right. Lele Sadoughi makes feel-good accessories that remind you how much fun it is to lean into girly-girl style.  Materials: Raffia, Beading, Leather Colors: Natural, Pastel Rainbow, Navy, Picnic Plaid  Customer review: “As soon as I saw this I knew it would be the perfect summer bag. It fits the key items for an evening out and the shade is so subtle it works as a neutral complement. The beading is also a lovely touch.  The first evening I carried it, I had several friends ask where it came from and if they could borrow it.I've usually only bought Lele headbands but this was a my first and certainly not my last handbag purchase.” Raffia unexpectedly meets rhinestones in this under-$100 beach glam tote from VICI Collection. It’s the quickest, easiest, mid-sized carry-all to safely store a book, sunscreen, a towel, and more. Materials: Straw Colors: Natural  Known for quality footwear, Andre Assous recently jumped into the handbag category with a small selection of  bags. The construction follows suit of the brand’s footwear. The Atlas is a well-made bag with an outer pocket, fabric lining, and zip closure to safeguard your essentials. It can be worn with everything, making it perfect for weekend leisure.  Materials: Leather, raffia  Colors: Natural Platino  Why fit in when you were born to stand out? That’s probably the mentality Tory Burch had when embroidering her classic mini top handle totes with 3D resin beads. These statement-making minis are all dolled up with jewels. It’s a fun, unique take on plain woven straw. Materials: Raffia, Leather, Beading Colors: Cassia, Light Cream, Wild Leaves  Naghedi is known for its durable and sleek woven neoprene designs. The Havana is a summer pivot, inspired by Mediterranean beach umbrellas. What appears to be straw is actually woven neoprene. This means it’s far more durable and soft.  It comes with a zip pouch and a detachable, adjustable crossbody strap. The magnetic closure ensures functionality that matches style.  Materials: Neoprene Colors: Amalfi, Carrara, Almaza, Venice, Sky  Imported from India, this woven straw mini bag features an open top with fringe detailing. The checked print adds attitude to an otherwise sweet style. The bag is lined with fabric to protect your possessions.  Materials: Straw Colors: White/Cornflower  Hereu is known for quality leather goods, and this raffia, leather-lined, angular, tote bag is no exception. It’s made from a rich, woven two-tone straw and comes with a matching zip wallet. The base is structured, meaning it can stand on its own. The strap is big enough to fit over your shoulder, providing ample space for a day’s worth of necessities in a canvas-lined interior. It’s clean, classic, and timeless. Materials: Raffia, Leather Trim, Canvas Lining Colors: Dark Brown/Tan  Destined for an Italian vacation, this colorful woven bag from the Mercedes Salazar Revolve collaboration makes the perfect gift to yourself or a friend to celebrate an upcoming trip. With an embroidered patch and added charm details, there’s so much to look at. It’s a special piece that looks and feels like a work of art.  Materials: Raffia Colors: Turquoise  Customer review: “I wore this bag everyday in Italy. Great quality and even when it got smashed in my luggage. It didn't crinkle or break!” Even though it’s made with straw, this mini tote from Marni functions like a typical handbag. Thanks to its leather detailing and satin lining, the only thing that makes it a summertime bag is the straw exterior. It’s a designer staple and a must-have for handbag collectors.  Materials: Woven Raffia and Leather Colors: Tan/Brown  Certain styles inspire different vacation destinations, and this one is calling for Mykonos. The evil eye detail and brass hardware adds a bold statement to the woven boho design. Since it’s constructed with woven gaps, it comes with a removable drawstring pouch to ensure your essentials are safe.  It’s not structured, which means it’s easy to pack (in other words, ideal for a European vacation). Materials: Raffia Colors: Beige  Altuzarra’s signature Watermill Tote is a tried-and-true style fans of the brand love. The cage-style leather straps and knotted straps give an unexpected edge to the straw design. From summer outings in the Hamptons to beach clubs in the Carolinas, it’s a sophisticated bag that can pack a ton. Material: Leather, Raffia Colors: Natural/White, Natural/Black, Pinto  If you didn’t know Rothy's made bags, now you know. This roped hemp tote bag might seem like a departure from the brand’s signature knit, but this style is also machine washable. It’s a game-changer when it comes to summer tote bags—where spills, splashes, and sand are unavoidable. It’s durable, flexible, and spacious. Plus, it’s reversible to a solid black tote if the multimedia design doesn’t suit your outfit. Materials: Hemp Colors: Black, Camel  A designer handbag aficionado knows that such collectibles come in all shapes, sizes, and seasons. Inspired by Italian beach clubs, this basket tote is one to add. The multicolored plexiglas logo is playful and bold, paying homage to the spirit of an Italian summer.  Materials: Natural Woven Straw Colors: Natural/Pale Green  This might look like a bag too basic to make this list, but let us grace you with the tip that the criss-cross detail serves as straps for your beach hat. Different hats can switch up the style of the bag, allowing it to be a blank canvas frame. Plus, it’s easy to fold up and pack, ideal for storing in your luggage. Hats off to Hat Attack for solving the problem of needing to carry or wear your beach hat. Materials: Straw Colors: Natural  Sometimes, the best things in life are black and white. Let DeMellier’s Large Capri straw tote serve as a fine literal example. It’s a simple bag but impeccably designed, with leather detailing stitched to the hand-woven raffia. The raffia leaves used are all locally sourced, harvested, dried in the sun, and dyed chemical-free. Upon opening, you can feel the love poured into making this simple and special accessory.

              " \"Never compromise style for comfort with these. Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. The comeback kid over the last few seasons is undoubtedly a lovely ladylike-gone-cool-girl shoe named Mary Jane. What once was a conservative classic has returned in versions spanning viral trends like balletcore, quiet luxury, ladies who lunch, and even sporty hypebeast. From ballet flats to sneakers, loafers, platforms, and block heels, these shoes cater to every style inclination. The shoe not only blends nostalgia with a modern flair, but it’s a comfortable and wearable trend—as long as you choose wisely. Every brand name has launched its take on the Mary Jane shoe. From Sandy Liang to Prada, Marc Jacobs, Dr. Martens, and Marni—as well as Sam Edelman and Steve Madden—you couldn’t hide from style even if you tried to. With that in mind, I’ve tested a plethora of styles and scoured the internet for reviews to ensure you have the most comfortable options available. So, whether you’re looking for a chic everyday shoe or a statement piece for a special occasion, the wide selection of Mary Janes ahead will never have you compromising comfort for style.  A stacked heel is always a more comfortable option than a stiletto or kitten heel. This heeled, square-toe version of a Mary Jane from Tony Bianco is made from soft, genuine leather and a rubber sole. In other words, you get a soft insole and grippy traction in the form of a ladylike dress shoe. Colors: Black Sizes: 5-10 Material: Leather A summer version of your classic Mary Jane leather flats come in this two-tone espadrille version from J.Crew. These Spanish-made shoes feel like luxury comfort for under-$200. The jute stitching and espadrille platform adds a touch of seasonal jazz, while the overall style and silhouette reigns classic. Colors: Black, Ivory Sizes: 5-12 Material: Leather Customer review: “These are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. They look so elegant, and you can wear them with casual jeans or you can dress them up with a little black dress. I love them. They fit true to size! I recommend them.” A bold (and bright) take on the OG Weejuns by G.H. Bass might be one of the best juxtapositions to grace our shopping carts. The saturated color in durable leather—that softens and gets better with age—is rare. Weejuns are known for personalized comfort after a short break-in period. If the bright color isn’t your jam, be sure to scope the other retailers for alternate options. Colors: Pink, Black, whiskey, wine Sizes: 5-11 Material: Patent Croc Embossed Leather Customer review: “I was so surprised to find that these are super comfortable. I love Weejuns, and I adore this style, but I expected I would need to return these for being too pinchy and narrow. They aren't at all. They're lovely and wonderfully dressy and classic, and COMFORTABLE!” Vivaia’s “comfort heels” pretty much broke the internet through targeted ads (sorry, not sorry, if you haven’t seen them yet—you’re going to want to). This modern take on classic ballet flats features the same shock-absorbing midsole and contoured footbed that makes the brand’s heels so comfy.  You get sneaker-like comfort and an anti-slip grip in a sophisticated style.  Colors: 12 options Sizes: 5-11 Material: Antimicrobial knit Customer review: “Love the shoes, they fit perfectly, look great, and are so light and comfortable.” Even though they don’t seem like it at first glance, reviewers claim these to be “the most comfortable” shoes. As a huge fan of Bared Footwear, I support the claim. The shoes are designed with comfort at the top of mind. The secret sauce is the biomechanical footbed, providing cushioned comfort and efficient arch support to reduce heel pressure and provide support.  Plus, the square-toe element of this design provides a roomy footbed, which is helpful for people who suffer from plantar fasciitis.  Colors: Black, navy, leopard, red, silver, white Sizes: 34-43 Material: Leather Customer review: “These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. So much fun and so many compliments!” Chunky rubber meets Marni’s soft leather in this shoe, which is a match made in heaven in the world of comfort and wearability. It’s the brand’s popular Pablo sneakers in Mary Jane form, and it’s just begging to get styled with a feminine frock and socks (or is that just me?!). Colors: Black, White Sizes: IT35-IT41 Material: Leather, rubber Over the last decade, Dolce Vita has emerged as a major on-trend brand of affordable, high-quality footwear. It’s the best place to go for relevant styles that won’t break the bank and won’t hurt your feet. This pair of square-toe metallic flats is just that. Colors: Red, black, brown, gold, silver, ivory Sizes: 6-11 Material: Leather Customer review: “Absolutely love these flats. They're buttery soft, easy to close, and they don't look too school girly. The ivory goes with everything. They fit true to size. I am considering getting the snake print next as a fun neutral!” Prada’s take on the Mary Jane is balletcore at its finest. The chocolate brown and gold hardware combo makes this seasonless and worthy of the designer's investment. Italian-made footwear from the highest-quality materials is as good as it gets.  Colors: Brow, Red Sizes: 35-41 Material: Satin Madewell’s Greta flats are a bestselling style that continues to gain popularity and emerge into new versions, textures, and colors. It’s a simple, wear-with-anything shoe made from soft Italian leather and a new and improved cloud-like lining for superior comfort. Colors: 11 options Sizes: 5-12 Material: Leather Customer review: “I hadn't intended on buying these shoes. But something about them reminded me of ballet classes I took as a kid? - stayed with me. Now I have them and yes, they're great. The cushioning inside was an unexpected plus - I don't ever remember my real ballet shoes ever being this comfortable.” Anyone who owns a pair of Docs knows that the required break-in period is worth the wait. Luckily, with its take on the Mary Jane, the that time period is cut in half. You get the same foot-forming leather, durability, and tread as the brand’s bestselling boots but in a ladylike design. Check out the multiple retailers for a variety of colors.  Colors: Olive, Tan, Black, White Sizes: 5-11 Material: Leather Customer review: “The nostalgia of these shoes makes me feel youthful and free-spirited. I love them. The comfortability and quality are on point.” The Vibram sole might have been partially included for the fashion irony of this design, but that doesn’t mean it’s not real. Vibram soles provide the best quality, durability, comfort, and traction for active outdoor footwear, and this pair of Ganni Mary Janes features all of that. Consider this gorp-y footwear a style that actually lives up to the hype. Colors: Black Sizes: 36-39 Material: Rubber, nylon Open-weave Mary Janes acts like sandals with more support and without exposing your toes. So, if you’re a few weeks overdue on a pedicure, this is the shoe of summer to get away with. The woven leather provides breathability, while the leather basket weave gives a secure fit via soft leather. Colors: 8 options Sizes: 43-45 Material: Leather Customer review: “So cute & so comfortable. I never review anything, so it's a testament to how much I love these.” With over 1,000 five-star reviews, these machine-washable ballet flats earned a spot on this list. What feel like slippers on your feet are actually sophisticated footwear you can wear out and about. They are soft and comfortable, with a cushioned insole and rubber outsole for outdoor traction. Colors: 10 options Sizes: 5-13 Material: Recycled knit Customer review: “I got my first pair of Rothy’s and they have been all I needed to pack in order to match outfits on my recent trips to Morocco, the English countryside, and various metropolitan cities! So comfortable and I’ve done endless walking in them. I will definitely be buying more in other colors! People keep stopping me to ask me where I got them, that must be a great sign!” HEREU makes footwear using leather so good you can smell it from blocks away. This modern take on the Mary Jane is both on trend and timeless (and on sale)! Colors: Brown Sizes: 35-41 Material: Patent Leather The juxtaposition of skater girl style with a feminine detail is giving the sneaker of summer. If an all-white shoe isn’t for you, check out the various retailers for a ton of other colors like red, black, yellow, and blue. Colors: Ballet Rose, White, Black, Red, Stripe Sizes: 6-10 Material: Cotton canvas Customer review: “I am so happy I grabbed a pair of the new Vans’ Mary Janes! I appreciate the much lighter and lower profile design over the lug sole. They have a non-textured, smooth rubber toe cap. They are so comfortable and super cute! I get compliments each time I have worn them! Great job, Vans!” If you’re a Clark Wallabees collector like me, this is a must-have pair to add to the arsenal. The Mary Jane detail dresses up the otherwise super casual moccasin-inspired desert shoe. For those who aren’t collectors, this is a great gateway into the world. The soft suede and rubber outsole is an entirely new world of comfort. Colors: Maple Sizes: 6-10 Material: Suede Mules are the easiest shoes to wear thanks to their slip-on/slip-off method of dressing. This pair from AGL remains as functional as ever, with soft leather inner and outer and a curved footbed.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. “Even my derm has remarked on the difference.” Want to know if a product really works? Welcome to Slow Beauty. Since it can take up to six weeks to see results from using a new formula, we have testers try the best and buzziest in hair and skin care for double that amount of time to determine what actually makes a difference. Confession: Even as a seasoned beauty editor, I have never used an eye cream in my life. So, when ELLE asked me if I wanted to test La Prairie’s new Skin Caviar Eye Lift Serum for three months, I was on board right away—no convincing necessary. (What can I say? It’s about damn time.) If I’m being honest, my eye area is currently one of my biggest concerns; I’m quite self-conscious about it. As I’ve gotten older, my dark circles have gotten darker, often making me look tired even when I’m not.  And lately, I’ve noticed that tiny crinkles have started to appear in the corners of my eyes and my heavy lids have gotten droopier. The horror! Needless to say, I am the perfect candidate to test out this eye treatment, and was excited to get started.  Week 1 The product is super silky and glides on easily. It’s separated into two chambers: tiny yellow caviar beads (yes, it’s that luxe) and a beige-ish complex that mixes together as you pump. A little goes a long way—you only need one pump for both eyes. The first time I used it, I was overly enthusiastic. I did two pumps and had too much left over on my finger. (I ended up using the rest around my lip area, because lip wrinkles aren’t cute either). Fast-forward a few days, and\\xa0I noticed an immediate radiance to my eye area. The skin didn’t look so crepey underneath. Also, there was definitely an instant tightening sensation that gave my eyes a light lift and perk. I also noticed that the serum\\xa0made me look more awake, even after I had\\xa0pulled an all-nighter. Maybe I won’t need blepharoplasty after all! So far, during week one, everything has been good. I have had no adverse reactions—like milia (those unsightly tiny bumps that you can get under your eyes), which I’ve experienced with other eye creams. And although I haven’t noticed any dramatic changes so far, it’s only been one week, so that’s to be expected.\\xa0 Week 2 I noticed that my eye area started to tingle lightly after I smoothed the eye serum on. This happened during my first week of using the product as well. The tingly sensation lasted only 30 seconds and didn’t happen every time. It doesn’t bother me too much, especially\\xa0since I assume it most likely involves the complex’s tightening and firming mojo magic. My dark under-eye circles look about the same, but the area overall looks more radiant. As far as the fine lines? I think they look a teeny bit smoother.\\xa0 Week 3 On Wednesday of this week, I fell asleep without putting on La Prairie’s Skin Caviar Eye Lift, but I don’t think it affected my results. The outer edges underneath my eyes appear smoother and more radiant. The inner area is still crepey-looking; hopefully, it will look less so as the weeks go on. Week 4\\xa0 It’s been a month of using the eye cream, and I’ve noticed a difference in the appearance of my under-eye area. I don’t know if others have noticed the difference, but I certainly do. My eyes look more alert, and the skin under them smoother.\\xa0There is also a lot of product left. I think I’ve only used a tenth of it—a little really does go a long way. It seems like this container will last me several months. Week 5 My under eyes look smoother, and there’s definitely a luminosity. I’ve also been smoothing the serum on the top of my lids. I don’t really notice any changes apart from the fact that they seem a\\xa0bit more glowy. Week 6 Lately, I’ve noticed that after I wash my face, my under-eye area has been looking drier and more crepey. When I smooth the eye serum around my orbitals, it appears more\\xa0hydrated, but without it, not so much. I haven’t changed my cleanser, so I’m not sure why this is happening. Could it be the eye serum drying it out? Maybe. Or perhaps my eyes have always been that way, and I just haven’t noticed before. I will have to keep a close watch, stay tuned. Week 7 This week, my eyelids look a little lighter and a little more radiant. The outer corners also are a little brighter, but the inner corners remain dark. As for this delicate area\\xa0looking dry after I wash my face? I am happy to report that it is no longer the case! Week 8 I’ve been using the La Prairie Skin Caviar Eye Lift for about two months now, and dare I say—I think my eyes look more youthful. Definitely more buoyant and alert. My under eyes and top lids are\\xa0brighter and not as dark as when I first started. Plus, both areas look smoother and less crinkled. Week 9 I’m happy to report that my under eyes look smoother and hydrated. I don’t look so haggard. My eyelids are a\\xa0little bit less dark, too. As for my under eyes, the outer corners are significantly less dark than the inner corners. I’m not sure what to do about this, as I think the inner corners were always darker. From now on, I’m going to tap the serum into the inner area of the under eyes morning and night while only smoothing it on the outer corners in the evenings to see if that will help even out the\\xa0reduction rate of my orbital shadows. Week 10 Even though I fell asleep last night without doing my nighttime skincare regimen (again!), my eye area looks bright and alert this morning. It doesn’t look puffy or droopy. (Yay!) The under-eye region continues to appear smoother and less wrinkly. Week 11 I am generally pleased with the results that I have been getting, and this week is no difference. My eyes continue to look bright and alert. The texture of my skin around them is\\xa0more supple and smooth. And though I did not get much sleep Sunday evening, I still somehow look well-rested. No puffy eyes here. Week 12 I am in the final week of testing the eye serum. Sadly, I got sick on Friday and spent the weekend in bed, and admittedly looked ragged and dehydrated for most of that time. But this afternoon, I finally felt well enough to do my skin care routine. And while I still feel under the weather, I don’t think I fully look it. The serum gives my eyes a brilliant effervescence that disguises my current state and plumps up the skin so it doesn’t look or feel desiccated. From the outside, I give the impression of being\\xa0refreshed, even though I don’t necessarily feel that way. I really enjoyed using La Prairie’s Skin Caviar Eye Lift Serum. Not only was the experience luxe (who wouldn’t feel extra fancy and relish incorporating a sensual silky serum made from caviar extracts into their skin care routine, morning and night?)—the decadent eye serum actually works. It’s often said that your eyes are the first thing people notice. After three months of use, I can attest that my orbital area looks noticeably brighter, less wrinkled, and all around more joyful. Even my derm has remarked on the difference.  And while $570 is admittedly a lot to spend on an eye cream, after 12 weeks of use, I still hadn’t finished the bottle; in fact, I still had about a third of it left, which should last me another five weeks. That said, the cost per use isn’t really that bad when you break it down. Plus, isn’t it worth it if it does what it’s meant to do? Your eyes—and you—deserve the best, after all. 10 Best Dermaplaning Tools Megan Thee Stallion Reveals Her Prime Day Picks The Best Sunscreens Aren’t Sold in America The 12 Best Sunscreens to Soothe Sensitive Skin The 12 Best Acne Spot Treatments for Clearer Skin Should You Use Nipple Cream On Your Lips?

When you think of iconic fragrances, Thierry Mugler’s Angel is certainly at the top of the list. At once edgy and delicate, this balanced scent combines sweet notes of vanilla, ylang-ylang, and jasmine with spicy aromas like bourbon, pepper, and amber.  If you’ve ever dreamed of cruising down the iconic Pacific Coast Highway in a vintage convertible, this is the scent you’d wear for the drive.

Summertime has always had a way of bringing about some of the most playful makeup trends. As we all dream of upcoming vacations on tropical beaches, afternoons spent poolside, and long sunny days that bleed into warm, adventurous nights, TikTok is filled with beauty inspiration to kickoff the summer.

One could argue that there are few things in the world more beautiful than a sunset. Vibrant yellow and orange hues cascade into a sea of pink atop the most mesmerizing canvas, creating a scene so alluring it’s hard to pull your eyes away. I’m not talking about the sunset in the sky; I’m talking about the sunset on your face.  Sunset blush is a viral trend of mixing orange and pink to mimic the look of a sunset. While the finished look may seem difficult to accomplish, sunset blush is surprisingly easy to achieve. “Start by applying a deep, pink blush to the temples and the highest points of the cheeks, then layer on an orange blush onto the apples of the cheeks, ensuring it seamlessly blends into the pink shade,” says Baltimore. “To enhance the luminosity of the look, finish off with a touch of gold highlighter at the highest point of the cheek, ideally where the two blush shades meet.” But the secret to a flawless finish is the application. Whether you prefer to use a makeup brush or a sponge to apply your blush, getting a seamless blend is the key to achieving the ombré look.  The original creator, Alissa Janay, whose video has amassed over eight million views and one million likes on TikTok, starts by dotting the liquid blush directly onto her face and then blending out the product with a blush. While this is a great option, other techniques may be better for makeup novices who are looking to get similar results. Baltimore suggests “tapping the product onto a brush and stippling it onto the face” as an alternative. “This technique grants enhanced control over coverage, precise placement, and seamless blending, ensuring a flawless outcome,” she says. Beyond the different techniques that you can use, there are many reasons why sunset blush is all over our TikTok “For You” page. This trend follows a long line of recent beauty waves that center playfulness and creativity when it comes to makeup, and blush plays an integral part in how we can experiment. “Throughout my beauty journey, I’ve encountered a myriad of products, from intensely pigmented formulas to effortlessly blendable textures. However, my favorite blushes seamlessly combine both qualities, ensuring a flawless application every time,” says Baltimore. Trying different formulas, placements, and shades can transform your everyday look into a work of art. Bring your blush to the high points of your cheek for an ethereal editorial look, or bring it down to the apples of your face and across your nose for an adorable doll-like finish. Boyfriend blush is another great example of the power of placement with your makeup.  Contrary to what the name suggests, boyfriend blush actually has nothing to do with your relationship status. This trend is all about enhancing the natural flush of your face. Using more orange blush tones, this trend is a callback to makeup looks reminiscent of  the ’90s and early 2000s beauty looks, with beauty TikTokers referencing icons like Devin Aoki as pioneers of this trend.  This blush technique applies blush lower on the face instead of to the highest point of the cheeks. Starting at the apples of your cheek and blending downward just below where you would contour will reveal a youthful flush of color that looks great on any face shape.   Though the season usually calls for more vibrant tones, cool tones are having a moment this summer. Blue hues had their moment to shine earlier this year. Now, purple-toned blushes have become the go-to product for achieving an effortless, ethereal makeup look. An unexpected color choice for a blush, purple is great for adding a more defined and pigmented finish. The rich purple shade often shows up as a more vibrant pinkish tone, making for the perfect flushed blush look, especially for those with deeper skin tones or more neutral undertones. Try adding pearly iridescent shades atop a lavender or deep purple blush to get the glowy sunkissed look that is bound to quickly become a crowd favorite. These trends prove that incorporating and mixing colors and testing different techniques can easily elevate any look. Though these trends come just as summer is beginning, that doesn’t mean they end when the season is over. Blush will always be a versatile staple beauty product, and with new techniques surfacing, there is no limit to what you can achieve with the simple swipe of a brush. 10 Best Dermaplaning Tools Megan Thee Stallion Reveals Her Prime Day Picks The Best Sunscreens Aren’t Sold in America The 12 Best Sunscreens to Soothe Sensitive Skin The 12 Best Acne Spot Treatments for Clearer Skin Should You Use Nipple Cream On Your Lips?

Because of this, I’ve perfected my selection of waterproof, transfer-proof, and sweatproof products. Whether it’s a skin tint for a Paris filter-like finish or sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast, I like products that perform while making me look effortlessly put-together. As I gear up for fun in the sun, these picks have become staples in my carry-on. Keep reading; I’m sure you’ll find your travel companion below.” “Summer is the season I come alive. I’m miserable in the winter and am typically tucked away, correcting, repairing, and nourishing my skin, so it can shed any dead layers ahead of the warm months. The moment the temperature soars to the 80s or 90s, I’m only focused on wearing less and going out more, which means my legs need to be polished and hair-free, my body needs to be glowing and protected by SPF, and my makeup needs to be sweatproof. If there’s one thing I know how to do best, it’s fake a vacation look with all the bronzing and radiant formulas I keep in my arsenal—and now you can, too.” “As a summer baby, I’ve truly claimed the season as my own. I thrive on sunny days, whether I’m relaxing on a faraway beach or enjoying a picnic with friends in a local park. But no matter what, sun protection is top of mind; my mainstays include big hats, beach umbrellas, and more SPF-filled tinted moisturizers, lotions, and sprays than one might deem necessary. There’s also nothing like a fresh scent to enhance my warm-weather euphoria. When I smell as good as I feel, I’m ready to take on the world.” “Baby hairs are not the easiest to master, and excessive manipulation of the edges can cause thinning or breakage. The same way we use a cleansing oil to thoroughly break down all our face products from the day, this one was created specifically to do the same for edges. Following the success of the viral Rosemary Mint Strengthening Oil, this cleansing oil removes old, dried-up edge control, courtesy of rosemary, mint, biotin, and witch hazel, to keep hair refreshed until wash day.”—NP “My poor hair has suffered through years of heat styling without protection. It’s so much happier now that I spray it down with this heat protectant before straightening it. I can barely tell that I’ve applied anything, but the spray does soften my strands and prevent frizz—and, of course, supplies protection against up to 450°F. The scent is something to behold, too; I’ve gotten multiple compliments on how my hair smells with this product in it.”—CL “Dae makes you feel good about what you’re putting into your hair. Whereas some dry shampoos typically come in aerosol spray form, this one is a talc-free powder that sops up oil on the strands and blends into the hair seamlessly, regardless of your hair color, with no residue left behind.”—NP “Spending hours in the sun and swimming in the salty sea can’t be beat. However, you’ll find that your tresses are often dehydrated and frizzy after your adventures. Enter: The Color Wow Money Mist Leave-In Conditioner. Because it’s so lightweight, it won’t weigh down fine strands like mine; instead, it provides a burst of moisture and protects against heat and UV rays. I even find that the spray helps my natural waves retain their texture and resist frizzing up, and detangling is a breeze when I spritz it on right after a shower.”—CL “Let me spill the beans: Tangle Teezer’s latest launch is composed of 85 percent castor beans in an effort to cut down on unsustainable materials. The brush is still just as gentle and deft as the brand’s other offerings, and it has two layers of teeth: a longer one to undo wet tangles and another to smooth the strands. I dread brushing my hair wet, because I can hear the tears as they happen, but I’m never afraid with this one.”—CL “Is it your natural Brazilian tan, or did you get some help from Sol de Janeiro’s Rio Radiance Oil? No one will ever know. This body oil contains SPF 50 and gives your skin the gift of glow. It’s going to be my travel companion all summer long.”—DJ “Fans of the original Orange Gelée rejoiced earlier this year when Vacation brought back the classic orange-tinted SPF. Due to its gel-to-oil formula, rich with shea butter and coconut oil, the sunscreen leaves behind a sun-kissed glow without any stickiness or residue. The formula doesn’t smell like sunscreen, either; its scent is a blend of sophisticated notes of bergamot, patchouli, and sandalwood.”—CL “This chemical sunscreen won’t leave your skin dull, gray, or greasy. I was pleasantly surprised when I applied it to my face and didn’t need to follow up with a primer. This lightweight formula plays so well with my makeup and doesn’t make me break out.”—DJ “If you’re anything like me, you’ll apply sunscreen everywhere before stepping onto the beach and often neglect your lips. Now that I have Seaweed Bath’s lip SPF on hand, I have no excuse; the zinc oxide-powered lip balm feels so moisturizing and comfortable on the lips that it’s never a chore to reapply.”—CL “Finding a mineral sunscreen that says it works for all and actually does is a tedious process—but that all ends with Live Tinted’s Hueguard. With a slight tint and hydrating ingredients, Hueguard works in three parts: it primes, protects, and moisturizes.”—NP “This cream is the result of over a decade of research and development, bringing science to your skin. The formula includes bio-placenta growth factors and lab-grown peptides that mimic human growth factors to rebuild collagen and reverse visible signs of aging. It has a yellow tint, but rest assured, it hasn’t gone bad. It gets its hue from the nutrient-rich blend, which includes sea buckthorn oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and a peptide complex. I highly recommend incorporating the O2 Niacinamide Eight Active Serum and O2 Caffeine Eight Active Eye Cream alongside this product for a simple but effective skin care routine. It’s been a game changer for my skin.”—DJ “La Mer’s Purifying Mask serves one purpose: ridding your skin of the deep-seated dirt and debris that could wreak havoc come morning. Formulated with La Mer’s signature Miracle Broth—a mélange of vitamins, sea kelp, minerals, and more—and a clarifying ferment made of antioxidants and enzymes, your skin will appear clearer and pores more refined.”—NP “We’re told to eat our vegetables, but don’t forget about the powers of fruits as well. In this formula, pineapple stars as the potent enzyme working to slough away dead skin while polyglutamic acid, a humectant, restores moisture. Even pitted against a full-glam face, Rhode’s pineapple cleanser can take on the challenge—and succeed—in just one wash.”—NP “Although every day doesn’t require a double cleanse, I turn to this superfood toner when I want to ensure my skin is free of leftover makeup and environmental impurities. The two-in-one formula also exfoliates and nourishes, and it’s packed with antioxidants from the fermented berries.”—DJ “We all love the warmth of the sun’s rays, but they can be responsible for some of the most visible signs of aging. Medik8’s potent vitamin C serum contains a powerful and stabilized form of the antioxidant, along with ferulic acid, which work to brighten skin as well as diminish and prevent dark spots and wrinkles.”—CL “I come from a Caribbean family and spend a lot of time at the beach and on boats. EltaMD UV Clear 46 is a mainstay in my morning rotation, so I was elated when the brand released a tinted version. It blends seamlessly into my skin, resulting in an even tone that’s protected from the sun.”—DJ “A true bad gal doesn’t have to forgo her flawless makeup look for sun protection. Marrying skin-soothing ingredients with the superb finish of its skin tints, Fenty Skin’s Hydra Vizor Huez matches your complexion, smooths skin, and imparts a sheer-yet-buildable coverage that makes you forget you’re wearing sunscreen.”—NP “I tend to shy away from liquid bronzers, because they leave my skin looking muddy, instead of adding warmth and a sun-kissed glow. Not this one—Saie’s bronzer is perfect for beginners as it blends easily and provides a dewy finish. Start with a few dots, because it’s highly pigmented.”—DJ “The trick to mastering vacation makeup isn’t a skin tint or mattifying setting spray. While both are important, an all-encompassing face palette in a bi-fold case is the true must-have. Compact and lightweight, this product features six shades for easily customizable concealer, foundation, or even contour. Housed on the opposite side are blush shades to make your makeup work for you, not the other way around.”—NP “Olaplex has been keeping our hair healthy for years, and it’s finally designed a product to boost our brows. Not only does this serum promote new growth and definition, it also works as a brow gel to keep those little hairs in place—perfect for no-makeup-makeup days. You’ll notice that your eyebrows feel softer over time.”—CL “This waterproof lip liner won’t budge once you apply it. There are five flexible shades to choose from; my go-to is Café Touba, a hickory brown that gives me a natural, effortless look when paired with my favorite lip treatment oil.”—DJ “A vacation is the perfect time to change up your look with a bold lip color or two. The new shades of Bobbi Brown’s Extra Plump Lip Serum include a juicy raspberry, a bright red, and other eye-catching hues. However, there are plenty of softer ones if you’d like to stick to those. Plus, the botanical oil-rich serum is so sheer and forgiving that I reapply it throughout the day sans mirror.”—CL “I can’t stand lip balms that feel thick and goopy. I want the formula to sink into my skin and moisturize it, but I don’t want the balm to suffocate my lips. Tower 28’s SOS LipSoftie fits the bill with its non-sticky formula and an ultra-hydrating blend of jojoba oil, lysine, and shea butter. The product gets bonus points for the round applicator, which makes it fun and easy to apply.”—CL “This lip oil has earned a permanent spot in my everyday tote bag, because it feels so nourishing on my lips. With 92 percent natural origin ingredients, this skin care-makeup hybrid coats my lips with a beautiful, soft tint and leaves them moisturized with a subtle sheen. Plus, it’s not sticky like other lip oils—another reason why I always keep it around.”—DJ “You know what pairs well with a tequila-soaked mojito? A soft kiss of color on the rim from your new favorite lipstick. The Slim Lip Color Shine coats your lips with an emollient-rich wash of color that’s pigmented with just one swipe.”—NP “I love nature and spend a lot of time outside in the summer. But when temperatures turn hot and humid, it can be disastrous for your makeup. When I don’t want to risk my foundation sliding off, I’ll opt for this formula for photo-ready skin. It’s buildable but dries quickly, so make sure your skin is hydrated, and apply it intentionally with a beauty blender—otherwise, your makeup might look splotchy.”—DJ “Lately, I’ve been wearing this highlighter under my skin tint to give my face a subtle glow. It has skin-loving ingredients, including hyaluronic acid and niacinamide, which immediately hydrate your skin and brighten it over time.”—DJ “Shaky, unsteady hands have found their reprieve. Formulated with champions in mind, this eyeliner from Serena Williams is a summertime dream. Draw your wings without fear of the color fading or migrating. Even better, the quick-drying formula and matte finish allow you to step out in the sun, ready to conquer whatever curveballs are thrown your way.”—NP “The rose-colored palette is perfect for everything—literally! I use it as eyeshadow, blush, lip liner, and lipstick. It’s nice to have one palette that can do it all. It’s a permanent staple for me while traveling.”—DJ “This setting spray went viral for a reason. Spray this fine mist across your face to keep your makeup in place, no matter what’s going on. My glam always stays fresh on hot days.”—DJ “Botox isn’t for everyone—and by everyone, I mean me. I’m not quite ready for injections, but I do want to minimize and prevent fine lines and wrinkles. Each of these treatment sets contains semi-circle patches to target crow’s feet, strips for your forehead expressions, and a patch for frown lines. The blend of retinol, vitamin C, and a peptide complex keeps my skin smooth and bright.”—DJ “Have you ever finished shaving only to discover spots of hyperpigmentation left behind from body acne and pesky ingrown hairs? The Fur Dark Spot Vanish Patch is dotted with microdarts full of brightening ingredients, like niacinamide and tranexamic acid, to banish those dark spots for good. It takes at least six hours for the microdarts to dissolve, so the patches are perfect for leaving on during an international or cross-country flight.”—CL “Can’t go to the spa? Try one of these eye masks, and the spa will come to you. The self-warming mask comes with hooks for your ears, so you can sit back and relax. The packaging says it steams, and while I didn’t experience that, it still had a calming effect.”—DJ  “No need to run from aging, but there are a bevy of products available to delay those early signs, including these golden collagen-boosting and elasticity-restoring hand masks. The serum is comprised of hyaluronic acid, peptides, and more to keep your hands soft, youthful, and bright.”—NP “This isn’t your everyday lip gloss. This formula plumps and hydrates, instantly minimizing fine lines, and leaves my lips super soft. It comes in 14 different shades, my favorite being Shanghai, a vibrant red.”—DJ “While natural deodorants are arguably better for you, many fall short of staving off body odor. AKT is the only natural deodorant that lasted through my Saturday morning Orangetheory workout, followed by a day of errands. My favorite of the scents is Orange Grove, which reminds me of Fruit Loops. If its efficacy doesn’t impress you, its presentation sure will. Packaged in a tube, you can squeeze it onto your fingers or apply it with AKT’s gold applicator for a luxurious experience. Pro tip: Purchase the golden key to roll down the tube, and squeeze out every last drop.”—DJ “Shea Moisture is one of my go-to hair brands, so I was excited when it expanded into deodorant. The Even Tone formula contains vitamin C and niacinamide and will have your armpits summer-ready in no time.”—DJ “I gave this to a friend who doesn’t need to do much to start sweating, often leaving her with wet marks under her arms, on her lower back, and even on her intimate areas. This deodorant was the solution to years of embarrassment, and now she’s ready for summer.”—DJ “There’s nothing unsexy about deodorant, especially with Santal Bloom in your arsenal. A proven ally, even in the most stifling heat, your pits have never been treated better. Salicylic acid eradicates odor and keeps the pits clear of hyperpigmentation or painful ingrown hairs with a long-lasting formula that’s perfect for every lifestyle.”—NP “By Rosie Jane champions the idea that a well-rounded olfactory experience doesn’t start and end with perfume. Outside of its eau de parfums, it offers natural deodorants that are all aluminum-free with a pleasant smell to match. Each spray kills odor-causing bacteria via a blend of aloe vera, glycerin, and sugar cane alcohol.”—NP “I love using this oil—it leaves my skin so hydrated. The fast-absorbing formula minimizes the appearance of cellulite and stretch marks. Whether used by itself or to amplify the richness of your body cream, this product softens your skin and makes it smell like roses. It also acts as a great floral base for scent layering.”—DJ “This cream and powder highlighter duo can be used in multiple ways. When I want a dewy finish, I start with the cream and lightly press it into the high points of my face. For a bolder look, I apply the powder directly. If you mix both, you get a beautiful depth that’s unmatched.”—DJ “Mutha might as well have named this cream Mutha Body Butter: Vacation Edition. Inside the purple jar is the same rich concoction of cocoa, shea, and mango seed butters from the beloved original formula, but the cherry on top is the sprinkle of mica that glimmers and glows when applied to the skin. Feel free to tell everyone you woke up like that—it’ll be our little secret.”—CL “Are your legs looking a little dull in that bikini? A few swipes of this tinted serum will do the trick. This isn’t quite a tanning lotion, but it gently enhances your natural skin tone to reveal a filter-like finish worthy of a magazine cover.”—NP “Last summer, everyone wanted to smell like pistachios. This summer, Irene Forte wants you to put them on your face. The star ingredient of this anti-aging oil is phytomelatonin, the plant version of melatonin, which contains powerful antioxidants to boost skin renewal and combat the effect of free radicals. This is the final step in my nighttime skin care routine, and I wake up with smooth, soft skin without fail.”—DJ “Soft Spot smells like the aroma of summer approaching. The soft, citrusy scent dances with aquatic florals and dries down to reveal a smooth musk. This will be my go-to for summer nights.”—DJ “If you can’t make it to St. Barts this summer, you can still create the vibe via this heavenly aroma. In one sniff, this tropical scent will transport you to the Caribbean. I can’t get enough!”—DJ “For the uninitiated, this is a floral, citrusy fragrance with an earthy, green finish. It’s fun and playful but not overpowering, making it the perfect airy scent for schmoozing at an outdoor soirée.”—DJ “The first word that comes to mind when I smell Thousand Palms is green. Inspired by a lively oasis in the middle of the Mojave Desert, its notes of bell pepper, coriander leaf, and patchouli conjure visions of lush palm trees swaying in the wind. The scent is available in a chic, TSA-friendly solid, but I always have a bottle of the extrait waiting for me at home, just in case.”—CL “What’s better than snacking on almonds? Smelling like them. L’Occitane’s body wash packages the same heavenly aroma found in its cult-favorite shower oil and body milk in this creamy whipped formula that nourishes the skin with sweet almond oil.”—NP “Sara Happ is an ELLE favorite—our entire team loves the brand’s various lip balms and glosses. But the sugar- and oil-based lip scrub is our most prized possession. Dry flakes stand no chance against the formula, which gets our pouts smooth, silky, and ready for lipstick within seconds.”—CL “Properly prep your skin ahead of makeup application with this gentle face exfoliator. EADEM’s signature FastFade technology smooths and brightens with AHAs and PHAs, reducing texture and upping your makeup game. The formula also soothes the skin using rice water and colloidal oatmeal, preventing irritation or a weakened skin barrier.”—NP “My skin care sin is that, sometimes, I don’t regularly exfoliate, leading to dull and textured skin. But these resurfacing pads make exfoliating a breeze. They are powerful, so if you are new to acid exfoliation, I’d use this product every three days to start. If you have sensitive skin, opt for Naturopathica’s Pumpkin Purifying Enzyme Peel instead.”—DJ “Why not wake up and start your day with a burst of citrusy goodness? The exfoliating properties of the plant-derived konjac jelly in this body wash tackle dead skin and reverse dullness, sans any harsh stripping. Follow up with the fragrance mist and body lotion to keep the good vibes going.”—NP “For a while, I was washing my hair nearly every single day. But this formula provides a deep, thorough cleanse that keeps oil and flakes at bay, allowing me to go days without shampooing. Traveling with just a carry-on? No problem. The brand just released a travel-size version that’ll sail through TSA.”—CL “Purchase this to own the best flat iron on the market. This tool heats up in 20 seconds to 365 °F, and its advanced motion technology prevents overstyling and heat damage. The ghd Chronos is also a favorite in the ELLE office.”—DJ “I rave about this round brush to anyone who will listen. I’m currently growing out a bob, and it’s reaching all of those awkward lengths where the most manageable way to wear it is to straighten it, instead of wearing my natural-but-unpredictable waves. But that doesn’t mean I want to spend a lot of time styling, especially while on a trip. That’s where Mane’s Hot Round Brush comes in. Minutes into running it through my tresses, my hair is smooth and bouncy, with no tangles but plenty of shine.”—CL “Although at-home (or at-hotel room) treatments can’t come close to an in-office treatment, Althaea Skin’s  C∙A∙R∙A Multi-Modal Tool is an impressive on-the-go alternative. With powerful blue and red lights, the device works to fight acne, plump skin, and repair the harm that sun exposure and pollutants wreak on our face during the day. Because it’s so compact, I don’t hesitate to slip the tool into my carry-on, even on weekends away.”—CL “I usually prefer to bring my own hair dryer rather than rely on the device that may or may not be in my hotel room. After all, I have no idea how it’ll perform or how much dust—or something worse—has been stuck in the dryer for months. The SilkyAir Pro works for pretty much everybody since it has three magnetic attachments: a diffuser, a small concentrator, and a wide concentrator. Heat damage is kept to a minimum too, since the tool constantly assesses the air temperature and tweaks it automatically when things are getting too hot.”—CL “Lightweight and compact, this laser device is the at-home hair removal companion you’ve been looking for to upkeep maintenance. Powered by 133 flashes per minute, the Pure Mini Lite is suitable for the body and face and reduces hair growth, when consistently applied, in about 12 weeks.”—NP “Calling all Barbz! Nicki Minaj collaborated with her longtime nail artist Yvett G to dream up a collection of stunning press-ons inspired by the rapper’s famously attention-grabbing sets. The first collection features nearly a dozen designs in various classic shapes and lengths to match any outfit and vibe. I tried a French manicure set, and they were so thin and nicely molded. Everyone thought I had gotten a gel mani on my natural nails!”—CL “Glam girls, you don’t have to hit up the salon before hopping on a plane to your next destination. Pop this kit in your bag and apply the press-ons during the ride—you’ll land with a fresh and fun set that makes it look like you spent an hour with your favorite nail tech.”—CL “If you’re headed to a balmy, verdant paradise, it only makes sense for your fingertips to match. OPI’s Pricele$$ is a creamy green that echoes the leaves of thriving flora. The polish dries quickly to prevent accidental smudging and can stay chip-free for up to seven days.”—CL “Opt for this polish if you want to get into the jelly nail trend while nourishing your nails at the same time. It leaves a natural and buildable rosy glow, and it’s perfect for the clean-girl aesthetic or anyone trying to rehab their nails from an acrylic manicure gone wrong.”—DJ “Sometimes, my feet don’t necessarily need another pedicure, but rather a polish change. This nail polish kit, which is great for weekend trips, contains the perfect shade of red, a ballerina pink, a two-in-one top and base coat, and a nail file—everything you need for a DIY mani-pedi. Bonus: The polish lasts a long time.”—DJ Megan Thee Stallion Reveals Her Prime Day Picks The Best Sunscreens Aren’t Sold in America The 12 Best Sunscreens to Soothe Sensitive Skin The 12 Best Acne Spot Treatments for Clearer Skin Should You Use Nipple Cream On Your Lips?

              " \"“I understand Tina’s journey, because it felt like my journey.” When Liza Colón-Zayas first set out to audition for the role of Tina Marrero in The Bear, her character was a bit of a mystery. With only one scene to go off of, she didn’t know much about Tina’s background, her motivations, or even whether her partner in the scene, Sydney, would be a man or a woman. But after 30 years in the business, Colón-Zayas has made peace with the unknown.  A native New Yorker who first started performing in the city’s theater scene, the actress also branched out into film and TV, booking roles in dozens of shows, including Law & Order, Sex and the City, and Dexter. By her count, she’s faced “thousands” of rejections, but she takes them in stride, secure in the fact that so much of this industry—whether a project gets greenlit, whether it becomes popular, and whether it gets a second season—is out of her hands.  Three seasons in, though, The Bear has become a runaway hit. Audiences and critics alike have rallied around the chaos of the fractured family and constantly distressed restaurant staff at the heart of the show. In that time, Colón-Zayas has tried not to box Tina in, waiting patiently for the writers to reveal more about the once-prickly line cook.  “Tina’s never been spoon-fed to the audience,” Colón-Zayas tells ELLE.com. “I appreciate that. She was a mystery, even to me sometimes, but I never judged her. For me, it was important to always find the humanity in her, and trust in her journey.” Last season chipped away at some of Tina’s armor, as she threw herself into culinary school, became Sydney’s (Ayo Edebiri) sous chef, and delivered a soul-baring karaoke performance of Freddy Fender’s “Before The Next Teardrop Falls.” This season, which largely relies on flashbacks, we learn even more, finally understanding how Tina wound up working at the sandwich shop.  In “Napkins,” directed by Edebiri, we meet Tina in 2018 just as she’s been laid off. With her husband (played by Colón-Zayas’ real-life husband, David Zayas) counting on a promotion that may never materialize, she’s faced with the cruel reality that she’d spent years devoted to a company just to be cast out into a workforce that places little value on women her age. Colón-Zayas deftly steps into the spotlight, delivering a commanding performance in one of the strongest episodes of the season. It’s been an unexpected journey for the actress, but a rewarding one that’s allowed her to bring to life a character that’s all too rare in prestige TV.  “It’s been such a surprising turn,” she says. “But I just feel like if audiences walk away taking a moment to see the potential in a character like Tina, in people that normally get ignored, then we’ve done something powerful.” Colón-Zayas spoke with ELLE.com about season 3 of The Bear, working with Edebiri, and her comfort meals.  It was very emotional. I cried a lot, and I just felt very blessed. Because I get it. I understand Tina’s journey, because it felt like my journey. So to actually shine a light on that in such depth? I just cried a lot. [Laughs] It felt like a dream come true.  Getting to learn about her story, it was beautiful. I felt like, Yeah, why can’t she have this beautiful, loving, supportive man at home? Yes, she’s dealing with the day-to-day struggles of gentrification, layoffs, and the rent being jacked up—those are the real pressures of being working poor. But even in my brain, I hadn’t assumed what her home life was like, so I loved being caught off-guard.  I knew I was gonna be fine with my husband. We’ve worked together before, and just like in real life, he holds me down in the best way. He’s my rock. I was more concerned about not wanting to let anybody down in the Jon Bernthal [Mikey] scene. It was our first scene together, and even though I knew he was a darling, I was also a fan of his, so I just really wanted to give that scene all the nuance that it deserved. Exactly. I think on that day, Tina just wants to not be evicted. She says “I don’t need to save the world, I just want to feed my kid.” To see how she’s come from that to the present, trying to keep up and not fail—that stress is still there, she’s still facing down these mountains in front of her, but now she’s trying to hold onto a new dream.   Yeah, and it’s not playing out in a stereotypical way. It’s not this story of her transforming into a sexy character in order to see her value or something like that. The backbone of this country looks like Tina, so let’s give a little more credit to what people like her have to bring and have been bringing to the table.   It was almost like Tina finding her family at The Bear. We were all the broken toys who had something to give. It was never meant to be something revolutionary, it was about creating a space where you could work on whatever you wanted, and no one got to tell you that, because you’re Latino, it wasn’t something for you. That was my artistic home, because I just really didn’t see myself anywhere. And I don’t say that out of pity, because I think it just speaks to our resilience as a Latino-centered theater company at that time. And it speaks to my resilience that I never gave up. I just kept trying to stay alive, as an artist and a human, trusting that the angels would open up the doors for me somewhere.  We started with her home and the food. That was the launching point, so we were just thinking: What would this home look like for a working class family? What would we be eating? What would the kitchen look like? What would be on the walls? We just wanted to pay attention to that authenticity. But also, we had two years of trust built together, and the respect that women of color have for each other, even with our age difference, we see each other and hold each other up. So collaborating together in this way, it was so smooth. I just love her. She’s outstanding.   Definitely. I think our relationship is rooted in respect. I mean, my girl has been writing and doing comedy since she was 20 years old. I have mad respect for what she does, because it takes courage. But I also didn't realize until a little later, that she had seen me in a bunch of New York plays before The Bear, so she had that respect for me. I also just love that we get to show that when you have brown women working together, amazing, powerful things can happen. Let's keep going in that direction. Oh, it will always be rice and beans. Rice, beans, and meat. With my mom, it was always a simple, pounded steak with the cebolla and the gravy, just falling apart with the rice and beans and platano. I actually didn’t like to eat a lot as a kid. I always felt like I should be spending time playing. But if my grandmother made something, I was eating it: pastelillos con queso, con carne, whatever. There was just something about that act of love.  This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " 'Beauty culture is toxic. Beauty culture is fun. With her new essay collection, Sable Yong asks, Why can’t it be both? Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. Sable Yong enjoys a complicated relationship with beauty. She loves it. And she hates it. She’s a beauty writer, but only occasionally a beauty expert. (“Oh, God,” she groans. “The word ‘expert’ gets thrown around so much.”) She wrote a book about beauty, but it’s not easy to describe. (“I don’t have an elevator pitch for it,” she says. “I have a please-sit-down-for-10-minutes-and-let-me-talk-about-this pitch.”) This “yes, but also” nature of both Yong as a person and her chosen subject matter translates directly to Die Hot With a Vengeance, her cheeky essay collection probing beauty culture and the many confusing reactions it arouses.  In fact, targeting the conflicting reality of beauty itself was Yong’s ultimate goal: She noticed a dearth of beauty writing that bridged the gap between service or commerce-oriented content (like “how to do makeup,” Yong explains) and academic feminist research (like “beauty as a tool of the patriarchy,” she says). Yong envisioned the sort of collection that’d acknowledge both the pleasure of looking good and the hierarchies that looking good reinforces. “We are constantly trying to reconcile this huge, huge cognitive dissonance between enjoying beauty, and having it be meaningful for us, but also understanding that the origins are not great for most people,” Yong says. But putting that sort of nuance into a “coherent package,” she says, was an extreme challenge, even for a former Allure editor comfortable with the contours—no pun intended—of the makeup, skincare, fragrance, fitness, and wellness industries.  Yong had always been a quick-witted writer; she got her first gig at the beauty site xoVain, sister site to xoJane, thanks to a particularly entertaining Craigslist entry she’d posted in search of a roommate. Writing about beauty for xoVain “was a really cool way to get into writing for the internet,” says Yong, who didn’t have a journalism degree or magazine writing experience at the time. But she remembers being told, “‘No, we just want you to do what you already do, but focused on beauty.’ I was like, ‘Oh, okay. That’s pretty easy.’” After her work at xoVain and other beauty-adjacent sites eventually caught the industry’s attention, she moved to Allure in 2017, where she worked as a digital beauty editor until 2019, growing familiar—sometimes too familiar, she feels—with the ever-expanding pile of products that’d accumulate on her desk.  As Yong tested hair dyes and eyeshadows and lip filler and multi-hundred-dollar facials, she questioned how much of her experimenting was a revelry in self-expression, and how much was a money- and power-driven acquiescence to toxic beauty standards. Yong writes in Die Hot With a Vengeance, “There’s money to be made from exploiting insecurities as well as celebrating individuality, and often the only difference between the two is marketing. Beauty sponsored by capitalism makes its pursuit a never-ending list because the ways that one can participate in beauty culture are now endless.”  Die Hot might not answer every reader’s questions about how best to engage with beauty, but it offers a position from which to study those questions with humor and compassion—and a sharply critical eye. Ahead, Yong expands on her own evolving relationship with these questions, and addresses how the explosion of beauty content on social media has shaped our very concept of “beautiful.”      Honestly, that was the trickiest, most challenging part of writing this, because I don’t have the answers for everyone. I can have the answer for me, but that’s out of my personal experience. The truth is, it’s something that’s constantly a back-and-forth negotiation. Just, like, four years ago, I don’t think beauty was as urgently prevalent as it feels it is today. A lot of that has to do with the pandemic. A lot of that has to do with TikTok and social media. A lot of people equate what’s viral with what is the official new creed of beauty, which isn’t true at all. Whenever I read things about TikTok trends becoming the new beauty standards, I’m like, “Absolutely not. We do not have the attention span to uphold this standard.”  The reason that beauty standards exist and have existed for as long as they do is because they are so weaved into our political history and patriarchy and racism and misogyny, and because they uphold a ruling class. That’s why they work. I don’t think “strawberry girl makeup” is going to do that. I don’t think “eyebrow blindness” is going to do that. Because I’ve worked in media, yes, I understand media is trying to capitalize on clicks by writing about these social media trends, but that also has the effect of compounding the importance that these trends didn’t have, but now they do, because they’re being covered by mainstream publications. So that’s two media forces feeding off of each other. That is the constant headache of today.  Now I’m in my late thirties, and I am fully embodying all the [beauty] shit that I wanted to do when I was a teenager, but wasn’t allowed to. If you can explore all the weird stuff that you like, but you feel like society tells you looks “bad” or you “shouldn’t do,” once you do it you realize, a) you’re not going to become a social pariah, and b) you might like it, or you might realize, “This isn’t actually for me.” Doing that bit by bit is such a great way to reconcile how  you feel beauty standards personally affect you.  It’s almost like immersion therapy. [You can observe] how little or how much it affects your life, or more importantly, how it affects the way you look and feel about yourself. That’s how you can explore what you feel is more authentically your identity from what you think it is or should be.  I definitely think that our purview on what is “beautiful” has expanded so much, which is great. But I also think that the expansion of inclusivity has mostly been inviting more people in to conform to the same standards.  Ten years ago, foundation shades ended at medium tan. Now, it’s like, “Great, we have more foundation shades for everyone of all colors, so you, too, can also feel the pressure to look hot.” We have access to beauty, that’s great, but with more access comes more pressure to do it. This is the crucial time to explore: What do you think is actually for you, and what do you feel is just the pressure to “do” beauty? I think it’s easier to be beautiful, but it’s harder to know what that means.  For a lot of people, yes, looking the part is almost akin to being the part. It’s not who you actually are; it’s what you can convince people you are. This [phenomenon] is very quiet and pernicious. The fact that injectables and all these beauty treatments are so widely accessible for everyone to smudge away whatever slight insecurities they have ... it’s not going to solve the insecurity so much as it is going to conform to the aesthetic of not having that insecurity.  Beauty is a very good tool to replicate the existing class structures that we have in place, because the more that you achieve the beauty standard, yes, you personally are improving your economic standing, and your social standing, and your mate selection and all that, but you are also, in the same way, compounding the existing social status that oppresses all of the things you were before.  It’s tough because there is this negotiation of who has the privilege to opt out, and what different types of tenets of beauty standards you possess. There was this one book I read before while I was writing the initial manuscript, called Perfect Me by Heather Widdows, and she described that there’s these four main tenets of beauty standards: thinness, firmness, smoothness, and youthfulness. So it’s like you have these four very broad tenets of beauty standards, and you can possess a bit more of one, or you can let go of one if you possess more of another. It’s this constant negotiation of how much of one you possess in relation to another [that dictates] how much you’re able to opt out of beauty standards without [as much] stigma. I have certain beauty privileges. I’m fairly, still, [considered] in the youthful category. I’m feminine-presenting, and I am largely considered a thin person. So, with those, I can get away with not shaving my armpits because it’s like, “Oh, well, you’re otherwise thin and feminine-presenting, so sure. And you’re young, so that’s considered more forgivable.\" I think you can push back depending on whatever your tastes are, or whatever aesthetics you prefer for yourself, can anyone truly just opt out? No figures really come to mind for me.   Social media just defines so much of appearance politics and beauty today. I feel like I had a much better handle on it five years ago. With the proliferation of so much beauty content, a lot of which is really well-made and thorough ... I’ve become a very lazy person, and I’m not willing to commit to doing this very, very well-curated content. I don’t think I’m adding anything to that conversation.  I don’t know what to do about social media these days. In the past, when I did post more, I would try to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek with it. If I posted a really well-lit, nicely angled selfie, I would, in the next slide, post an outtake that I thought was funny. Because we all know that the result of one good selfie is a hundred outtakes.  I think that’s what I find interesting with other people’s content as well, and [particularly] other people who do influencing professionally and are doing really high-level Reels and videos. I always appreciate it when they put a behind-the-scenes thing in there. You get very intimate with one another in ways that, probably, HR would not approve of. Because beauty is very personal, you get to share a lot of your inner vulnerabilities with these people—for work, yes, but also intimacy begets intimacy, no matter the context. In most office environments, you wouldn’t necessarily talk about getting a breast augmentation or getting a nose job, whereas when you work at a beauty publication, that stuff is table stakes. Sharing insecurities is, obviously, one of the fast-track ways to connect with someone, because connection requires vulnerability. ... It’s such a great way to learn the experiences that have made the people around you. And then you get this consensus of people who have nothing to gain or lose by telling you to get or not get this procedure. A lot of them are just, honestly, like, “Dude, you don’t have to do this,” or like, “Have you thought of all of the things involved?” The context around [beauty], with these people who are very informed, is such a lifesaver.

              " 'Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. The author of Fleishman is in Trouble and Long Island Compromise takes our literary survey. Welcome to Shelf Life, ELLE.com’s books column, in which authors share their most memorable reads. Whether you’re on the hunt for a book to console you, move you profoundly, or make you laugh, consider a recommendation from the writers in our series, who, like you (since you’re here), love books. Perhaps one of their favorite titles will become one of yours, too.  Taffy Brodesser-Akner is back, after her bestselling, adapted-for-Hulu first novel (2019’s Fleishman is in Trouble) with another family drama, Long Island Compromise (Random House), which she started writing before her debut. The staff writer for The New York Times Magazine is again adapting her work for streaming, this time for Apple.   The New York-born (in NYU faculty housing) and -based, Brooklyn-raised Brodesser-Akner was born Stephanie Akner but always called Taffy; was longlisted for the National Book Award and a finalist for the Women’s Prize; grew up in an Orthodox Jewish household after her mother became Orthodox when Brodesser-Akner was 12; spent a year at a university in Israel; went to film school and started her journalism career at a soap opera magazine; walked in with the groom to songs from \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" at their wedding; is a Proud AMC Stubs A-List member; was once branded Tom Hiddleston’s “mystery brunette”; has a golden doodle; bought Lizzy Caplan a Casio calculator watch like she has; has done an AMA; taught Hebrew school during college and a Dramatic Writing course at NYU, where she earned an MFA; and bought daily contact lenses when she first got TV money. Likes: New York magazine covers from the late 1970s and early 1980s; traveling, particularly to France and Switzerland; watching TV in bed with her kids in the morning, which she did with her mom. Fan of: “thirtysomething”; rewriting; jumpsuits and face oils; LivBreads bakery in Millburn, NJ; eating, especially with others; baked ziti; the Gap. Not so much: Starfuckery; revising; getting dressed, removing makeup; heels; taking care of herself; wine; the back row. Good at: Celebrity profiles (Nicki Minaj, her first full-length profile for GQ)once fell asleep during an interview; TV adaptations (FIIT was nominated for 7 Emmys, including Writing for a Limited Series); putting work aside; constantly pointing out what used to be somewhere in NYC; predicting whether couples will divorce; cleaning up after herself. Bad at: Carry-ons (she always checks luggage). May we suggest one of her book picks for your next airplane read?  Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, like the rest of the people on the train that day. I will never get over Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter, which is a perfect book with a perfect audiobook, narrated by Edoardo Ballerini. Here in the Dark by Alexis Soloski. I picked it up because Alexis is a colleague. I canceled plans later that day so I didn’t have to part from it. Buddenbrooks by Thomas Mann. I started reading it via a recommendation when I was stuck on my own family-centric novel. I put it down because it solved a problem immediately, and I went right back to work.  I haven’t laughed out loud while reading since I read The Netanyahus by Joshua Cohen, and then I read Big Swiss by Jen Beagin on my friend Reyhan’s recommendation. I am laughing just typing it. The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne, a crime thriller that covers the weirdest period in history and includes witch trial hangings, a multi-generational revenge plot, has every ingredient for appointment television. Tehrangeles by Porochista Khakpour is one I can’t stop thinking of lately (but her titles are always great. Read Brown Album)! The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead. I knew there was a turn at the end coming because I read it while my older son was reading it in school, but nothing prepared me for the perfect, inevitable conclusion of that story that had me clutching my heart and thinking about it for weeks after.  I have seen wilder sex scenes since, but I will never get over reading the dog-eared sections of Forever by Judy Blume in the camp bathroom while the rest of the bunk was asleep.  American Pastoral by Philip Roth. I read it in my 20s, and it showed me that every book isn’t just about what it’s about but also represents something larger about the world. You just have to figure out what that story is. It was also the first book I remember not being able to put down.  I finished the My Brilliant Friend series when I was there. I cannot recommend enough tearing through that last book in Elena Ferrante’s quartet while eating cacio e pepe near ancient ruins.   I’ve read The Corrections by Jonathan Franzen more regularly than I am willing to admit.  Patrick Hoffman’s new book, Friends Helping Friends, which I am right now reading in a Word doc (he and I are friends). I cannot put it down. I don’t often mind the Times’ rule that I’m not allowed to blurb, but I would like to sign this one from the rooftops.  Better Living Through Criticism by A.O. Scott. I read it after I finish any tormenting writing project. It reminds me that creation isn’t just the result, it’s the effort, and that everything is perfect in its effort.  Cue The Sun! The Invention of Reality TV by Emily Nussbaum has an excellent cover, a mix of vintage black- and-white image and vintage high-color typeface. I love it, because it so honestly belies the excellence and rigor and high readability of what’s inside it, which is an exploration of how my TV got this way.

              " \"The Search Party actor details the unexpected success of their zany production.  Places, please for ELLE’s monthly column Showstoppers, where theater’s biggest stars reflect upon the moment in their careers where the famous phrase “the show must go on” became a little too real. When things don’t go according to plan onstage, here’s how the pros react—and what they take away from it.  This month, Cole Escola, who wrote Oh, Mary! and performs as Mary Todd Lincoln in the Broadway production, talks about the time they fought off a fly with an axe. The former cabaret performer and Search Party star also talks about the breakthrough success of Oh, Mary! and how the critically acclaimed play came to the Broadway stage. There were a couple times early on in Oh, Mary! when one of the hoops broke in the hoop skirt. The dress is comfortable, and it’s so fun, but I had to rip the hoop out backstage, and then keep going.  That wasn’t so hard or interesting. I do remember earlier moments in my career, like in high school, when I fell off the stage in The Fantasticks. I remember in The Wizard of Oz in middle school, I was the Tin Man. There was this fly on stage, and it was so loud. The whole audience could hear it, and it was so big, and I killed it with my axe like a fly swatter. I remember it got applause. But then afterwards, I was like, “Oh, the Tin Man wouldn’t kill a fly. I’m so stupid!” Art first. Being in the show eight times a week just keeps me out of the word of mouth and reception. The show goes on. I didn’t have time to fully sit with much of the Off-Broadway reaction because it would literally be like okay, now I have to start my warm-ups again. It’s literally doing eight Barrys classes, no—it’s like doing 16 Barrys classes a week. Each show is two classes. I’ve been talking to a lot of other performers who have had long runs. I remember I talked to John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) about it. I talked to Cherry Jones (Angels in America). I talked to my friend, Jen Harris, who did Silence! The Musical for a few years. Some had little pieces of advice, but for the most part, it’s just like, you just do it. You just figure it out, and it’s different. There’s no secret. “Lately, I’ve been really terrified, scared, and anxious. But then, I had a moment where I was scrolling Instagram, and I got a targeted ad for the play. That shook me out of my misery. I realized, oh, you’re being an idiot, stop. Part of the fear and the anxiety is that this is so rare. I don’t want to fuck it up and have it go wrong. But then I realize, oh wait, this is so rare, you’re an idiot if you don’t enjoy it.” “I feel like I’m in the middle of a tornado, just like Dorothy. It’s not unpleasant, but everything’s so fast and so surreal. I am sure I’ll be able to reflect on it after the show closes, and I have some time. But right now, I wake up and I’m like, ‘Where do I need to be? Where do I need to go? What am I doing?’”  “As soon as I get on stage as Mary Todd Lincoln, I am just having the time of my life. Writing-wise, [Mary] is me, but in the way that all the characters that I write are me. Even Abe is me and all the other characters in the play are me. I’ve felt all of the things that [Mary] feels, and especially the having dreams that are embarrassing. We all care [about] what other people think about us, but we all have blind spots. Even the most self-conscious, codependent person who’s like, ‘I’m definitely in control of what other people think about me’—nobody really does. It’s crushing to realize you actually don’t have control over what people think of you, and even as much as you think you do ... That’s a huge fear of mine. I think that’s especially tied into queerness. All of the facets of Mary’s personality, and dreams, and fears are directly from me.” “I had the idea. I would tell friends about the idea, waiting for someone to grab me by the shoulders and shake me and be like, ‘That is the most genius idea I’ve ever heard. We have to go right now and you have to write this.’ Instead, they were just like, ‘Oh, cool. That sounds great,’ which was devastating to me. Then, I would forget the idea for a while. I’d be like, ‘Okay, I guess it sucks.’ But this idea just wouldn’t quite die; I couldn’t let go of it. I would have little scene ideas every once in a while I would email to myself. Then, during lockdown I had nothing going on, so I was like, ‘Okay, asshole, let’s see if you actually have an idea.’ I sent it to my manager, and then my manager sent it to an agent, and then the agent sent it to producers. It just kept getting pushed to the next step, until it finally got produced. It was slow, but there was never, a, ‘Looks like we can’t get the money,’ or ‘Oh! We need you to work on this before we produce it.’ It just kept getting pushed up the hill.” “I don’t think she would like it. I actually feel more connected to Laura Keene, who was the actress in Our American Cousin on the night Lincoln was assassinated. She was actress and producer. Weirdly, I don’t really think about the Lincolns, but I do think about her. I did this interview at the beginning of rehearsal [for the Off-Broadway production] where we took flowers to her grave, and part of me is like, ‘Oh, I better go take some more flowers,’ as if I think she’s the reason the show was a hit, and now I need to go and thank her. I need to ask her to watch over us for Broadway as well.” “Not at all! I loved the show. I was really proud of it. Personally, and artistically, creatively, it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Exactly what you see on stage is exactly what I dreamed it would be when I had the first idea in 2009. I thought and hoped that my audiences would love it. My audience, meaning the people that came to see me at Joe’s Pub, or The Duplex, or maybe their friends that didn’t get a chance to. I hoped it would be received well by them, and it never occurred to me that it would reach more people.” “This scratches the itch and then some. When I did cabaret shows, there was always this thing where I was like, ‘Why am I doing this?’ But, that’s another way Mary is like me. I do have that secret desire to be a cabaret star and just sing Cole Porter medleys.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " \"The actress explains what it was like filming her epic scene.  Spoilers below.  The last time we saw Rhaenys Targaryen facing King Aegon on her dragon, she did not attack. She might have burst into his coronation ceremony riding Meleys, but instead of burning him into a crisp right there and nipping war in the bud, she fled. The next time she faces Aegon, however, Rhaenys does not retreat. In fact, she and Meleys fight back until their dying breaths. In House of the Dragon season 2, episode 4, Rhaenys—in a dignified performance from Eve Best—flies into battle on behalf of Queen Rhaenyra and the black alliance. As the rider of the largest dragon with the most war experience, Rhaenys volunteers to use her firepower against Criston Cole and the green army on Rook’s Rest. But she doesn’t know that she was lured into a trap: Aemond is hiding in the trees with his enormous dragon, Vhagar, ready to strike; and Aegon has impulsively ditched the throne to fly into battle with his own dragon, Sunfyre. The Targaryens battle in the air, leading Aegon and his dragon to fall from the sky. But when it seems like Rhaenys might fly back to Dragonstone in victory, she straps tighter into her saddle and tells her dragon, “Attack, Meleys.” It’s a noble moment that Vhagar soon cuts short by grabbing Meleys by the neck. When Rhaenys realizes her dragon is on her way out, she lets go, and the two of them crash into the castle below.  It’s a bold ending for Rhaenys, dubbed The Queen Who Never Was, who had been on the sidelines ever since she was skipped over in the line of succession in favor of a male heir. Speaking ahead of the episode’s broadcast, Best jokes about the potential outcry from fans (or at least those who hadn’t read the source material, George R. R. Martin’s Fire & Blood). “They better be jolly upset,” she jokes. Best known for her past roles in The King’s Speech and Nurse Jackie, the Tony nominee and Olivier Award winner had a feeling the end was near. Her contract on House of the Dragon was only for two seasons, and after reading Rhaenys’ story in Fire & Blood, she knew it was finite. But she saved some surprises for herself the first time she and the cast read through the script together.  “In fact, I chose not to read it before the read-through because I just thought, I just want to see. I wanted to respond to it in the moment, as a punter, and also just see what my instinctive response is,” she says.  Speaking on Zoom from central Italy, Best chats with ELLE.com about Rhaenys’ battle and why this is her best onscreen death yet.  I was shocked! I was devastated, actually, on her behalf. And obviously, on my behalf, very sad to be leaving at this moment. In my career so far, I’ve died a lot of different ways. I’ve been burned, strangled, hung, bitten by a poisonous snake. It’s sad. But I’ve never fallen off a dragon. I don’t think that can be beaten, actually. It’s pretty sensational.  When you sign up for the job [on Game of Thrones or House of the Dragon], you know that it’s kind of written in that there’s likelihood that you’re going to go at some point. Because that’s the nature of the beast.  I was looking back at all the other deaths in the Game of Thrones that I could remember, and the deaths so far in [House of the Dragon] as well. And I thought, actually, hers is a pretty fantastic way to go. She goes out guns blazing as a 100 percent, wall-to-wall hero in every possible way. She’s their best fighter. She’s their best woman. A lot of the Game of Thrones deaths can be really humiliating, unpleasant, [and] disgusting. And this is a really heroic, very noble death. I said to Ryan [Condal, the showrunner] at the end of last season, “In season 2, she’s got to be a samurai. She’s got to just be full samurai.” And I think that’s exactly what we got. It reminds me a bit of that wonderful film The Last Samurai, actually. That nobility, that courage, that absolute clarity and spiritual purity that those fighters have, I think she had definitely come to that place by the end. She knows that it has to be her. It’s the voice of, effectively, the grown-up in the room saying, “All right kids, it’s okay. You can stand down. This needs to be taken care of. And actually, the truth is you all know. And in particular, Rhaenyra and you ought to know if you are a good and effective leader.” It’s almost her last moment of teaching. In fact, we changed that line right at the last minute. It was just, “Send me,” which still feels like a request or a suggestion. But what [writer and producer] Sara Hess suggested was, “You must send me,” which is absolutely final, which is actually an instruction, which is a moment of great teaching, of: This is how you are a good leader. You don’t go in yourself. You don’t go in because you are emotionally still very involved. There’s no way that you could be neutral in those circumstances. Plus, if you are lost, the whole thing is over. This is my instruction to you as a mentor and a guide and a friend, actually. This is what you need to do.  She’s stepping up to sacrifice herself because I think she knows absolutely damn well that this is a kamikaze mission. In this moment, I think there’s an unspoken but very important moment of acceptance and honoring. It’s very samurai, actually. It’s an honor between the two women, which up until now has always been very complicated. There’s a lot of tension between them. Even though there’s support on the surface and tremendous amounts of guidance and wisdom, there’s still a sort of tension, which is their murky past, the unspoken story of Laenor’s death, and all of that. In that moment, it was very important to me that Rhaenys is actually saying, “We’re good and the slate is clear.” That’s the last thing she says to Rhaenyra. And that’s samurai in a way. She takes care of her husband and she goes out to do the job. There’s just one moment of wobble, because my God, she’s got her hand on the nuclear red button, and she’s going to press it. And she’s got to take on board that responsibility of, A., starting the nuclear war, and B., the fact that she’s sacrificing herself. Her arc has been this absolute strength upon strength after strength, and digging deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper, and dealing with loss after loss after disappointment after grief, as it all builds up. She’s held onto everything, and I think that she’s never let anybody see any of it except for Meleys. In that moment when she’s making the samurai declaration of, “we’re off to battle now,” and connecting with the dragon, it’s just a tiny moment of “yikes,” when you see her vulnerability. And I asked for this. It was very important that there was a connection with Meleys, that you see the dragon respond and they’re taking care of each other in that moment. Because in the end, that’s the relationship. She’s having all these difficulties with her stupid husband who’s gone and got up to his nonsense. And they’re not communicating properly at this point. And Meleys, her dragon, is ultimately her only friend. That felt incredibly important. And that was part of the greatest loss. Part of the thing that was devastating filming the whole death sequence was seeing Meleys being torn to shreds and feeling that somehow she’d let her down or betrayed her in some way. Just the awfulness of seeing this brave beast, creature, other self being destroyed. That was all in my head, of course. It’s so bonkers. It’s miles away from what you actually see in the end product. You’re strapped onto this house machine, like a bucking bronco. It’s the height of a small cottage, and you have to go up steps to get onto it. And then you’re strapped in and the steps get taken away and you’re left on this house and it starts to move about. There’s just green screens and you and your imagination. And four strapping young men with enormous leaf blowers blowing wind in your face. And then, they cut up the sequence. It was quite a long sequence by film standards, although it was very short once it [was] cut together. But it actually took two weeks to film. Everybody’s doing [their dragon flying scenes] individually because there’s no interaction. They create the interaction through the edit. So you’ve maybe got a tennis ball in the distance, which is supposed to be Aegon. You have to really invent it. But then they chop up each sequence into little pieces. The moves became quite elaborate.  And at one point, I was hanging vertically, and the bucking bronco didn’t right itself straight away, so I was left a kind of prawn on the side of a ship, just panicking, just going, “Help, let me down. I’m too old for this!”  Oh God, and it was my last day of filming on the whole show. And it was also [very close to] the last day of filming the whole [season] as well, because the buck work was always done at the end of shoot. Ryan had come on set and made a big speech at the beginning of the day. The pressure for it to be a big deal was mounting so much. Then there was this long pause because they have to prep all of the moves on the buck electronically; it takes a long time. And then, they have to prep it with a stunt person to make sure it’s safe. There’s this big buildup of waiting for this moment, which is actually a split-second moment when she falls off the dragon, but it just was a complicated bit. I thought, well, we’ll do it loads of different ways. In your head, you think it’s going to be this very important and meaningful moment. And then, [we] came to it, and we did two takes and that was it. And it was over in a flash. Because of the buildup, I was also quite churned up. And I was like, “No, what?”  Yes! And I was feeling quite emotional because of the buildup of the day and the culmination of all the things. But what became really clear in the moment was the tremendous peacefulness about it, just because it was a physical and spiritual letting go of everything. And it was actually a release and something very freeing.  Giving in and allowing. It’s absolute acceptance. And the relief. We all know this, actually, that when you stop resisting something, there’s tremendous relief.  Yeah, exactly. Everything. I brought some bubbly for the crew and we had a very little celebration, which was really nice. That was lovely. Also, there was still work to be done, so there was not much time to linger. Because I’m sentimental, I want more of that. We did do it a little bit, and it was lovely and sad, and all those things. Part of the job description [as an actress playing a role] is actually that every time, you have to say goodbye and start over again, accept, and just let go.

With her first English-speaking role with an A-list director, the model and Squid Game alum is proving she’s here to stay. All clothing, accessories, and fine jewelry, Louis Vuitton. It’s a big bite, but it isn’t more than Hoyeon can handle. In front of the South Korean actress is a butcher’s feast of raw steak on a wooden cutting board. Executive Chef David Shim of Cote Korean Steakhouse uses shiny silver tongs to place the squares of meat—precisely cut, towering, perfectly marbled—one by one on a fiery barbecue grill. As they begin to cook, Hoyeon inhales with the kind of relish that most people reserve for a rose garden. “So juicy,” she says, grinning ear to ear at the meat perfume, the steam bathing her rosy cheeks. She takes a strip of red leaf lettuce, elegantly dips the tip of her chopsticks into the spicy ssamjang, and adds daikon cubes and a piece of glossy beef on top. In one smooth motion, she opens her mouth wide to reveal picture-perfect teeth (befitting the face of a Lancôme ambassador), folds the whole thing in half—and it disappears. Her eyes squeeze shut. Her face tips to the sky. She wiggles and shimmies back and forth on the wooden bench, bopping for a full minute in response to the dopamine hit. Her face, eyes momentarily squeezed shut, is tipped up to the sky and alight with delight. It’s her version of the Bart Simpson Happy Food Dance, and the opposite of the meat sweats. The meat joys? Meat euphoria? Meat glee?  “Mmm!” Beyond the meat bliss, Hoyeon has been feeling giddy about life in general these days. She continues to be a modeling force, with her finely symmetrical face appearing in magazines, ad campaigns, and the occasional billboard worldwide. Her debut acting role in Squid Game made her a breakout star in 2021 for her magnetic performance as Kang Sae-byeok, a North Korean defector with an “I’m not here to make friends” iciness, who participates in the deadly competition to provide for her little brother. A year later, she won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Female Actor in a Drama Series. Now she has 18.8 million followers on Instagram and fans all over the world. (When a group of NYC teenage girls wearing baggy jeans spot her outside the Chinatown coffee shop we’ve moved to post-steak, they quiver and audibly freak out.) Much like her character Sae-byeok, Hoyeon has a proven track record of not backing down from a challenge. Becoming an overnight sensation was the first step; landing her first English-language role in the Apple TV+ series Disclaimer, premiering on October 11 and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, the Mexican filmmaker who has won four Academy Awards, is next. With a hint of awe and incredulity, Cuarón says, “This is the thing about Hoyeon: Whatever she wants to do, she masters.” Hoyeon was raised in Seoul, the child of restaurateurs. She began taking modeling classes at age 16, and within a year was walking in shows at Seoul Fashion Week. She signed with an agent in 2012 and competed in Season 4 of Korea’s Next Top Model the following year, placing second. The defeat was crushing, but Hoyeon doubled down, spending hours devouring fashion magazines and practicing the poses of her favorite models at home in the mirror. In 2016, she landed an international agent and blazed onto the global modeling scene, dyeing her hair bright red to make herself stand out. (“I miss it. I want to go back!” Hoyeon says, but “I had to be in the salon once every two weeks.”) She made her New York Fashion Week runway debut in Opening Ceremony’s spring 2017 show, and soon after walked in Paris for Louis Vuitton. She has been a favorite of the house ever since, eventually becoming a global ambassador for the brand. Hoyeon began living the life of an in-demand model, posing for Chanel, Miu Miu, and Fendi, among others. She was traveling constantly and turned to books and movies to combat the loneliness she felt—hobbies that she credits with inspiring her interest in acting. She knew that the path from model to actress isn’t always smooth, but she wanted to give it a try. So when she had some downtime between modeling jobs in 2019, she took about two months’ worth of acting lessons before signing with a management company in Seoul. Squid Game was her very first video audition: In New York City for Fashion Week, she stayed up late into the night prepping. She taped herself reading three scenes, using the loneliness she felt to develop Sae-byeok’s reclusive personality. Hoyeon’s sudden fame after the show premiered came with its own challenges, and she says she spent a lot of time actively hiding her fear and anxiousness of being thrust into the public eye. She took a month off after the Emmys to process it all. Hoyeon describes the rapid ascension of Squid Game and her career in its wake like being suddenly “pulled over in a wave—a wave of things happening to me, rather than out of my own conviction.” It all whizzed by so fast that she’s not sure she was entirely conscious of how she felt in the moment. But when she reflects on it now, she comes away with a sense of extreme gratitude, coupled with the desire to make purposeful choices about what’s next. In conversation, she switches easily between English and Korean, using an interpreter sparingly during our interview. “In the beginning, I was scared because I thought, ‘I’m not prepared to have these kinds of jobs,’” she says. “But I realized that these are rare things. I can’t squander them. Now I can say with conviction that whatever opportunity comes my way, I choose to do this, I choose to have this.” The first order of business in Hoyeon’s new era is dropping her last name, Jung, and going by her first name only (pronounced Ho-yuhn). Not because she harbors ambitions of being mononymous like Madonna or Cher, she clarifies, but just for simplicity, given the various English spellings of her name. Second is purposely seeking complex work where she’s not merely a pretty face. Even her appearance in music videos of K-pop phenoms NewJeans features a tragic arc—and a chance to act alongside Asia’s Clark Gable and film legend, Tony Leung. (Our interpreter gasps when she learns that Leung and Hoyeon have had dinner.) Minji of NewJeans marvels at Hoyeon’s ability to effortlessly disappear into a role: “If I had to put it into one word, I’d say ‘eraser,’” she says. Or consider the South Korean series Chicken Nugget, in which she plays a food blogger who helps a woman who is accidentally turned into a nugget. Could Hoyeon act alongside an inanimate blob of chicken? As it turns out, she gives the best acting performance next to deep-fried food since a politician yucking it up at the Iowa State Fair. Third for Hoyeon: Stay a student. After Squid Game, she says, some veteran actors told her, “‘If you’re having trouble figuring out your next move, go to a project where you can learn the most,’” which turned out to be “exactly the advice that I needed.” Her education came in the form of Cuarón’s Disclaimer and its award-winning cast, including Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline. Based on the 2015 novel of the same name by Renée Knight, the miniseries features Hoyeon as the assistant of Blanchett, an investigative journalist who finds a book on her bedside table and is shocked to discover that she is one of the main characters. Cuarón says he had seen Hoyeon’s work in Squid Game and was impressed by her audition, noting that she was immediately receptive to feedback and that he “saw how her learning curve was intensely vertical.” Hoyeon, who has studied English as a second language since her school days, admits to me that she “was so stressed” about getting the accent right for the role. “But Alfonso was like, ‘Just breathe. Have your own accent,’\\u2009” she says. Hoyeon asked if she could work with the same dialect coach Cate Blanchett used. Cuarón calls her “very observant,” and would often see her taking notes during filming. Plus, he adds, “She’s the nicest person, and she’s fun.” In preparation for the role, Hoyeon spent some time in East London. “And what did you learn?” I ask. “Londoners like to go to Pret A Manger a lot,” she deadpans. “Breakfast is very important to them.” More seriously, she says, “The trick for me was to try to gain perspective on the cultural differences, but also to maintain the core humanity of what a character would carry as a person, as a human being.” As a model and actress working in Western and Asian cultures, Hoyeon has noticed other distinctions between them. “I got used to hugging when saying goodbye,” she offers as one example. “But when I [went home and] hugged Koreans, it was very awkward.” Hoyeon has said that when she first watched Squid Game, she thought she had “fucked up.” She texted the director: “‘I am so sorry.’” Now, she says, “I have more experience, but I still feel that I’m not good enough sometimes. But that also makes me keep working hard.” When she feels insecure, she thinks back on her early days as an unsure model. “When I first started modeling, I would always think, ‘Am I doing this right?’ The more experience I had, the more confidence I gained. So now when I’m standing in front of the camera, I’m like, ‘Hoyeon, you’ve got this, you are the best, you can do this.’” Even though she’s gone Hollywood, she won’t actually “go Hollywood”: “I am aware of hubris and wary of that in my acting,” she says. “It can lead you to forget that what we’re doing is a collaborative effort, and can sometimes create a rigidity in my thoughts or actions, so I really try to bring a mindset of flexibility and openness.” She’ll bring that mindset with her when she films another English- language part, this time in A24’s The Governesses alongside Lily-Rose Depp. Based on the Anne Serre book, it is a dark erotic tale about a trio of caregivers. What is not up next for Hoyeon, despite internet theories otherwise, is a reappearance in Squid Game season 2. When I ask her about it, Hoyeon gives me three different kinds of laughs to confirm. “No, you’re not in it?” I ask. “No,” she repeats, laughing politely—a chuckle. “No, I can’t talk about it, or just no?” I follow up. “No. No,” she says again, a mirthful, open-mouthed laugh that makes her lean back in her seat. “So it’s not a secret no? It’s just a no?” “No. No. No,” she repeats, shaking her head. This laugh is tinkly, definitive, and short—the sound of a politely closed subject. Fans of the show will be pleased to know that her Squid Game character does live on, though, in a sense. While filming the series, Hoyeon rescued a street cat, which she named Sae-byeok, and has since rescued another. “I’m in love with cats. They’re very unkind. But that’s why I love them,” she says with a shrug. The cats are currently with her boyfriend while she is away; she has been rumored to be dating South Korean actor and singer Lee Dong-hwi for several years. (She confirms that the internet rumors of Phoenix Suns player Devin Booker sliding into her DMs are fake. “I don’t even know who he is,” she says, her face furrowing in confusion. This is not shade—she just doesn’t watch the NBA.) In thinking about her roles, past, present, and future, Hoyeon says, “They really showcase the vulnerability of what it means to be human.” And that’s what hooked her: “In real life, we learn how to hide our feelings and emotions and not express them fully,” she says. “But when I’m acting, it’s almost like I’m able to release all that is inside me to the outside. That is a really therapeutic experience.” She also has a new theory about the beauty that comes from resilience and imperfection: “I feel like something is more beautiful when it is not perfect, but slightly broken,” she says. The challenge of depicting true humanity in all its forms is the biggest one: “Let AI do their perfect job,” she adds. “Let’s be human.”  Hair by Tomo Jidai for Oribe; makeup by Aaron de Mey at Art Partner; manicure by Alicia Torello at BRIDGE Artists; set design by Happy Massee at Lalaland Artists; produced by Hest Inc.

After an intense and isolating Furiosa shoot, the star is reveling in married life with Malcolm McRae.  For a long time, Anya Taylor-Joy kept a secret. Aside from her mother, very few people in her life knew the truth. Anything to keep the tabloids from finding out. The fact that she and a certain new man in her life were able to keep the story as quiet as they did—for as long as they did—was, she says today, “unbelievable.” To be clear, the secret she’s referring to was her shock appearance in Dune: Part Two, a minute-long fever dream that made international news and reportedly set up a major role in the next film. News of her cameo—unknown perhaps even to her costar Zendaya—broke just before the London premiere earlier this year. “I think Z had suspicions whilst filming,” Taylor-Joy says, adding, “I really wanted them to know. I didn’t just want to show up and be like, ‘Hi.’”   Yet there she was on the sand-colored “red carpet” in custom Dior Haute Couture, a white cape framing her face (Hi!). Nearby, Zendaya stunned in retro-futuristic Mugler. But to industry watchers, that night was about more than fashion. It was the unofficial coronation of a new class of bona fide A-list movie stars in Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, and now Anya Taylor-Joy. At 28, Taylor-Joy was a movie star with one tiny, pesky asterisk: She hadn’t actually starred in a blockbuster movie yet. That all changed this May with the launch of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, a prequel to George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road. And it’s a seriously big swing. That last film made approximately $380 million worldwide and scored 10 Academy Award nominations, winning six. It was also a notoriously difficult shoot. After seeing the film, Steven Soderbergh muttered: “I don’t understand how hundreds of people aren’t dead.” Adding to the challenge, Taylor-Joy inherited the title role from Charlize Theron, who played the one-armed Furiosa with a buzz cut and indelible grit. The inevitable comparisons would be intimidating enough for any young actress, let alone one tasked with carrying her first global franchise. For Taylor-Joy, it turns out there was a more personal question at stake: Of her whirlwind career to date, she says, “I had no idea what it was to put myself first in any way or how I wanted to exist.” We’re seated in a corner booth at a chic hotel restaurant, Taylor-Joy dressed in a blazer over a white tank top, her platinum blonde hair tucked behind her ears. As we talk, she stares back at me from across the table, arms folded, her face resting on her hands. It’s a gesture she used to great advantage in The Queen’s Gambit, an early quarantine success story that drew 62 million viewers and famously got young people horny for chess.  It’s been an unlikely journey over the past decade, from indie darling to IMAX screens. And it’s a story filled with strange coincidences and premonitions. “Sometimes,” Taylor-Joy says, “I’ll get these little flashes of truth where I just know something’s going to happen. It’s not a controllable thing, it’s just weird instinct.” When she got the call that her Furiosa casting was going public, she was in Belfast—walking directly past the movie theater where she’d seen Fury Road nearly a decade earlier. What are the chances? Later, she met with director Denis Villeneuve about a role in Dune: Part Two, but was told that her Furiosa schedule—coupled with COVID regulations—made doing both films impossible. But she felt certain this wasn’t the end of the story, insisting to her agents: “It’s not over.” Nearly a year later, Villeneuve called to offer her the role of Alia Atreides, sister to Chalamet’s rebel Paul Atreides, whisking her away to Namibia for a single day of filming. She tells these stories almost like a mystic reading tea leaves. Of Taylor-Joy’s essence, director George Miller explains: “There’s got to be that mystery, that ethereal quality, but there’s also got to be something accessible. That’s the contradiction. That’s the essence of charisma. You want to watch them. That’s what differentiates the movie star from us ordinary people.”  Furiosa is undeniably Taylor-Joy’s movie—a full-tilt, postapocalyptic origin story. Ripped from the mythical Green Place of Many Mothers as a child (a place of abundance in a world starved for resources), Furiosa was held captive by the Warlord Dementus (played with giddy charm by Chris Hemsworth in a prosthetic nose). But she made a promise to herself, or maybe it’s a threat: She would return home at any cost.  When Taylor-Joy read the script for the first time, she felt she knew this woman immediately. “The most beautiful and heartbreaking thing about Furiosa,” she says, “is that she’s the embodiment of impossible hope—living in a world where everything is a violation to you. The air that you breathe, the lack of food, the fact that empathy is punished, that trust is punished. And throughout it all, she just has this relentless conviction that she’s going to make good on that promise she made. I still get chills thinking about it.” Taylor-Joy has been on a similar quest from the jump, traveling the world but longing for a home. Born in Miami to a Scottish-Argentinian father and Zambian-Spanish-English mother, she was raised in Buenos Aires until the age of six, when the family relocated to London, a move she’s described as traumatic. “I never made sense in my school environment,” she says. “Everything about it was sort of telling me that there was something wrong with me rather than being celebratory in any way.” (Spanish is her first language and still the one that feels most true to herself, she says.) At 14, she ventured to New York for a summer directing program where she lived in a hostel, dyed her hair pink in the bathroom of a Chipotle, and exhaled for the first time in years. She later signed with a London modeling agency, which led to small acting gigs and then a break. At 18, she flew to Sundance for the premiere of a small, twisty allegory called The Witch and never looked back.    The Queen’s Gambit was a surprise sensation that won her a Golden Globe, an Emmy nomination, and a Dior contract. (She’s also a brand ambassador for Tiffany & Co.) But Furiosa was a singular challenge, mentally and physically. Taylor-Joy had not driven a motorcycle since an accident at age 19 in Argentina. “My best friend’s older brother had just bought a Ducati,” she says. “I went off on the bike in shorts and heeled espadrilles. I did pretty well until I had to stop. Then I went into a tree.” She shows off a scar on her left knee. “I got really, really lucky,” she says. “I lost quite a bit of muscle.”    Furiosa forced her to get back on the bike, to belabor the metaphor. Stunt car lessons followed (she doesn’t have a driver’s license), and then weapons training when she arrived in Australia for the six-month-plus shoot. Miller wasn’t concerned that his star was new to action films, praising a physicality born of her childhood days studying ballet. It’s something she and Theron share, says her director, but more importantly, “They’re both incredibly resolute.” He recalls more than once looking at a take on the monitor and saying to the stunt coordinator, “‘Hayley’s a great double for Anya.’ And several times he’d say, ‘That was Anya.’”  Adds Hemsworth, “I’ve worked with a lot of people who come from a different background into the action space. Some people don’t quite commit and never get there, but she certainly did. It was quite an iconic figure that she was stepping into, and she didn’t want to leave any stone unturned as far as preparation.”  In the end, the real mind-fuck wasn’t inheriting an iconic role—or even the massive set pieces—but rather the isolation Taylor-Joy endured. Furiosa spends much of the film alone and on the run. “I was really pushing the boundary of what my body and mind could do,” she says, recalling 3 A.M. rides to set. “I was driving through the streets of Sydney like, ‘I’ve not seen a single person in months. I haven’t seen anybody who doesn’t look like they’re in the Wasteland. I’ve been living in an alien world.’”  Looking back on the experience, Taylor-Joy says, more than anything she “wanted to be pushed. I wanted to really understand grit in a different way. Because I knew that I had it. But I understood that in isolation, I was going to really experience it. Okay, you’re in a house in the middle of nowhere with just your thoughts and this character. How do you cope with that? And when you don’t have comfort around you—when there’s nothing that you can turn to for distraction—how are you going to experience that?” She adds, “My favorite flowers have always been seeded dandelions or the daisies that grow through concrete. I think I wanted to be placed in concrete. I wanted to understand how that would feel. When you get too comfortable, you stop growing.” “I try not to get too caught up in the rest of it,” Taylor-Joy says of the movie star question and what that Dune: Part Two premiere spells for the future. “I just want to be able to do the thing that I love. And I hope that the purity of that love shines through.” But 10 years out from her first trip to Sundance—a line in the sand so thick it might have been drawn by one of those giant Dune worms—she’s been thinking about her career and the choices she’s made. She’s grateful to have had so many opportunities come her way, and couldn’t imagine saying no to any of them, but there’s a cost. “I woke up and realized I had not taken a break in 10 years. I’ve always been somebody who wants to take care of other people before taking care of myself,” she says. “I have always been sick, and working, or exhausted at dinner. I was like, I need to figure out what I do for fun.” A year ago, she promised to take some time for herself. Last year’s dual actors’/writers’ strikes forced her to follow through. And so off she went to Kauai, and then to Egypt. She trekked with gorillas in Rwanda. And, yes, she got married. After so many years on the move, she made a home with Malcolm McRae, 30, one half of the band more* (asterisk theirs). The couple’s September 2023 wedding at a historic palazzo in Venice included guests Cara Delevingne and Julia Garner. Naturally, the bride wore custom Dior. The couple had quietly eloped 17 months earlier, just before Taylor-Joy returned to Australia to shoot Furiosa. “We’re just real romantics,” she says of the secret ceremony. “We were born on the same day. And we wanted to make sure that our first experience was something that was completely for us. So we eloped in New Orleans with our two best friends and had the time of our lives. It was magical. But I’m lucky to say that the second experience—with all of our families—was so beyond beautiful, and I just feel very, very lucky.” The couple is now nesting in their home together in Los Angeles.  Taking some time to refuel looks good on her. This weekend, she says, she had her first day off in months, enjoying a hike on a nearby trail, getting a massage, and watching a Russian film. She’s also gotten into The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. Reality TV used to depress her, but a friend insisted they watch that infamous finale—“Receipts, proof, timeline, screenshots!”—and now Taylor-Joy is hooked: “I don’t know what happened in my brain, but I’m so invested. I’ve never seen so many people yell at the same time.” Of her own life right now—of marriage more than two years in—she says, “I’m an incredibly sensitive, hyper-feeling person. I did not realize that I could have more feelings, but I can. I feel so unbelievably lucky to be completely and utterly in love. I have found my person. I cannot believe that we get to do life together. And in talking about experiences where you get to grow, what an unbelievable thing to live your life with a mirror—and a mirror that causes you to become a better version of yourself.”  A world tour to promote Furiosa is about to begin. What she’s trying to do in this moment—on the eve of this next big chapter—is to hold onto the part of herself that went into this business for the love of it. “I got into this because I love art and I have no choice,” she says. “This is what I need to do.” Last week, she tells me, she slipped into Grauman’s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard to watch the Furiosa trailer from the back of one of the largest IMAX auditoriums in the world. “We went on a Tuesday,” she says, “and it was packed. It still feels like the kid part of me can go, ‘This is amazing.’” Almost as an afterthought, I ask, What did she hope for when she went to Sundance with her first film 10 years ago? “I hoped for magic,” she says.

For the queen of the dance floor and everyone’s big sister, life is only worth living if you’re having a good time. The first time Dua Lipa went clubbing, she was just a wisp of a tween girl in Kosovo. The UK-born pop star realizes how absurd it sounds as she explains it. Seated in her home office in London, flanked by shelves teeming with books, she thumbs through her phone for a blurry image of a photo from that fateful night—as if to prove to the two of us that it did indeed happen. At the center of the photo is a young Lipa dressed in white crochet, smiling brightly next to her much taller cousin and an entourage of stylish women.  Clubbing is a Lipa family tradition; it’s also why she wasn’t fazed when, while out one night on New York City’s Lower East Side with Charli XCX, she ran into her parents partying at The Box. “We celebrate everything and anything, and we just love a party,” she explains. “When I go to my aunt’s house, it all starts off pretty tame....Then the music comes on, and we’re all dancing in the house. And that’s a Tuesday!”  Now 28, Lipa has since made a name for herself as Britain’s leading lady of disco. On the dance floor, she plays an almighty oracle, a savvy young agony aunt for lovelorn club kids, desperate for the sobering real talk she’s dispensed in hits like “New Rules” and “Don’t Start Now.”   But long before she penned feminist electro-pop smashes that now stream by the billions, her family knew her as just Dua, their precocious eldest daughter who left Kosovo as a teen to fulfill her pop star dreams by herself in London. That’s when she fully harnessed what she calls her “big sister energy” in her life and music; one can hear it now in the unshakable authority with which she sings her songs. “She is such a big sister,” says songwriter Caroline Ailin, who first recognized Lipa’s insightful nature when they met almost a decade ago. “You process your feelings [with her], but you also walk away feeling empowered.”   Lipa recently announced her new record, Radical Optimism, out this month. She landed on the title after a friend introduced her to the concept—seeking the silver linings in an otherwise challenging world—which seemed to gel with her ethos, as a person and an artist. “It struck me,”she said in a press statement, “the idea of going through chaos gracefully and feeling like you can weather any storm.”  In the time she spent shaping her new album, Lipa decided she would first take her own advice and start calling all the shots: in her career, in her love life, and in her image. In 2022, she ended her longtime partnership with management and publishing company TaP Music, whose roster includes outsider divas like Lana Del Rey and Caroline Polachek. Lipa subsequently hired her father as her manager and bought back the rights and masters for her entire catalog. In February, Lipa inaugurated her liberated new era at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Gracing the red carpet in a custom Courrèges chain mail gown, her dyed red tresses cascading past her shoulders, she channeled a dauntless warrior queen. That night, she debuted the single “Training Season,” a new song from Radical Optimism. A jaunty disco track with theatrical flourishes of acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and live drums, it shows Lipa ramping up her bravado. “Don’t wanna have to teach you how to love me right,” she sings, issuing a notice to any less-than-suitable suitors looking to waste her time: She’s in the big leagues now. “I had gone into the studio and just said the line, ‘Training season’s over!’” Lipa recalls. Written in November 2022, “Training Season” is a reflection on a string of dates and long-term relationships, mostly set up by her friends. Lipa’s previous relationships include Bella and Gigi’s brother Anwar Hadid, and French director Romain Gavras; more recently, she was spotted vacationing in Mexico with British actor Callum Turner. “As long as everyone knows where they stand, then you’re good,” she says with a shrug.  She speaks only obliquely of her love life these days, preferring to drop hints in song. “I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to write down what I want,’” she says of “Training Season.” “The power of manifestation and writing things into existence with the power of words. When you know your worth, you know what you want and what you don’t want.” “I was talking about this with one of my dancers today, because she was going through a breakup—when I was single, I didn’t wish it away. You learn so much about yourself, you know, whether it’s going on a date or spending that time alone. In the silence, you figure out who you really are,” she says. “In the grand scheme of things, I was doing research.”  Radical Optimism was formulated with a crack team of co-songwriters and producers: Ailin, her trusted writer; Tobias Jesso Jr., hitmaker for Adele and Harry Styles; and Danny L Harle, PC Music alumnus and self-described “rave consultant.” As a massive fan of the Australian psych act Tame Impala, Lipa also tapped bandleader Kevin Parkerto join her crew in London. “We called it The Band,” Parker says. “Not an old-school band, but a spiritual band. Each morning going into the studio, I felt like I was in the Beatles!”  Inspired in part by the freedom-seeking spirit underpinning UK club culture, Radical Optimism dovetails neatly with the recent resurgence of two nu-disco queens who rocked the clubs in the Y2K era: Kylie Minogue, who came back hard last year with “Padam Padam”; and of course Sophie Ellis-Bextor, whose “Murder on the Dancefloor” needle drop in Saltburn landed her on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time ever. In Radical Optimism, Lipa brings together live and electronic instruments to fashion her own global groove. The result is a cosmopolitan dance-pop record with a 1970s flair, and a vibrant, resounding affirmation of life.   “Dua had this focus on finding this sound, which was so elusive,” Parker adds. “But it was nice to be in the engine room of the creative process, rather than worry about being the face of it. It was the experience that I’ve been waiting for.”  “Houdini,” the first single off the album, was born shortly after Parker teased out a bass line that he’d recorded for himself, weeks before their studio sessions. Lipa was quick to put her own stamp on it, introducing a moody post-disco melody. “She started singing, and it just immediately made sense,” Parker says. “This feeling of early-’80s sleaze, in some strange, dark, sweaty club. Gloriously suffocating. Hypnotic.”  Ailin has worked with Lipa since before they penned, along with Emily Warren and Ian Kirkpatrick, her 2017 breakout hit, “New Rules”—a dance-worthy laundry list of what-not-to-dos when an ex comes orbiting back around post-breakup. Venting about real life, Ailin explains, became essential to their creative process: “We have a little yap about what’s going on, and from that it turns into a pop song.” Lipa’s moments of unmanicured catharsis, Ailin says, are what yield her most penetrating lyrics; using the firm contralto of her voice, she imparts a pop wisdom that’s as incisive as it is compassionate. “That’s her superpower,” Ailin says. “It’s hard not to feel like you’re the strongest person next to her. I think she lends a little bit of that to all of us sometimes.”  Born in London in 1995, Lipa is the eldest of three children in a Kosovar-Albanian family. Her parents sought refuge in the UK in 1992, before Dua was born, because of political instability in Kosovo at the time. Prior to their emigration, Dua’s father, Dukagjin, sang and played guitar in a rock band called Oda, and her mother, Anesa, studied law. The Lipas settled in the Camden area of London, and Dua was raised to speak Albanian at home and English at school. Dua’s family returned to Kosovo in 2006, while it was still under the supervision of the United Nations. The country declared independence from neighboring Serbia in 2008, making it the youngest country in Europe. As she grew into her teens, Dua began to meditate on the horrific stories of ethnic cleansing and war crimes committed against Kosovar Albanians. It prompted a critical perspective shift for her, one that informs her values to this very day—whether that means being a fierce advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, or calling for a humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza.  “I heard stories from friends [in Kosovo] who lost family members. Houses burned. I saw them. When you have that direct communication with people who have been through [war], it opens up a completely new world, and it did for me,” she says. “I feel very close to [those suffering] injustices in the world, or inequality. Whether that be war, or coming out to your family, everyone’s got a different experience…It’s about support and learning together.” Lipa was only 15 when she returned to London alone to pursue a music career. She moved into a flat in Camden with an Albanian family friend who was attending university. After watching her younger siblings grow up themselves, it was a move that’s almost unfathomable to her now. “I said to my parents: ‘I don’t know how you let me do that,’” she admits. “But I knew that I didn’t have the same opportunities that I would have in Kosovo. I was so determined. I think my parents saw parts of themselves in me, and that allowed for them to be so open-hearted and generous with that trust.” By 17, she completed her GCSEs, or secondary school certification, and worked as a restaurant hostess to make ends meet. Working in nightclubs as a teen inevitably steeled her for the misogyny and exploitation baked into a male-dominated music industry. If she sounds well beyond her years in her songs, it’s because she earned it. “When I started [songwriting], I worked at La Bodega Negra, a Mexican restaurant that looked like a sex shop,” she recalls. “I’d finish work, then go out to whatever nightclub was happening until, like, three in the morning. Then I would wake up and go to the studio until I had my shift again at, like, 8 P.M. The music I [made] was reflective of my every day, or every night.” After ascending the charts again with 2018’s “One Kiss” with Calvin Harris, Lipa claimed the title of Best New Artist at the 2019 Grammys. She chased her success the following year with the release of her Grammy-winning sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, which leaked early on in the COVID-19 quarantine in late March of 2020. Despite the pandemic nearly extinguishing the club scene, Future Nostalgia became the singer’s first number one album in the UK, and rendered her one of the most-listened-to female artists on Spotify. (More recently, she became the first female artist to have four songs each with over 2 billion streams on the platform.)  Upon wrapping her Future Nostalgia world tour in December 2022, Lipa finally had time to exhale, for what felt like the first time in her adult life. She embarked on getaways from the Mediterranean to India this past year, and relished dining experiences with her family and friends in tow. After she posted her vacation photos on Instagram, the internet began dubbing her the “Vacanza Queen” poking fun at her for presumably going off gallivanting for months at a time. At first, the criticism felt dismissive of the years she spent without her family, toiling her way into pop superstardom. Yet perhaps it’s not just the glamorous photos from exotic locales, but also her efficiency as an artist that have concealed her hard work, making it seem magically effortless—the curse of being extremely capable all her life.  Lipa’s routine is still so regimented that it made an impression on Parker when they worked together in London.“Dua is, like, the most punctual person,” he says. “For most pop stars, it’s impossible to get to places on time. But Dua...she’s, like, apologizing profusely if she’s five minutes late!”  Through her media company, Service95, a weekly email newsletter-turned-podcast-turned book club, she has interviewed the Afghan American novelist Khaled Hosseini and the rock’n’ roll poet Patti Smith. She’s also co-executive producing Camden, a new documentary in conjunction with Disney+ that showcases the history of her home borough in London and the many influential artists who grew up there, from Madness to Amy Winehouse.  “I’ve been busy for almost 10 years” she says. “Every single day, I’ve had some bit of work to do. But people are going to say something anyway. People say a lot of mean things about a lot of people.” And if being Vacanza Queen “is what I'm getting, then I’ll take it. Whether I’m performing or going out, if it’s not fun, I don’t want it,” she says. “You have to make room for joy. The world can be burning down, but goddamn…if you didn’t spend any of your life trying to be happy, I don't know what you’ve done.” Hair by Ali Pirzadeh at Streeters; makeup by Sam Visser for YSL Beauty; manicure by Michelle Humphrey at LMC Worldwide; set design by Jabez Bartlett at Streeters; choreographed by Ryan Chappell; produced by WA Productions.

Whether she’s confronting the toughest emotions onscreen, raising millions to support women’s causes, or putting on a pinstriped suit to help save the movies, the Expats star brings people together. Bare feet tucked up on the couch, hands burrowed into the sleeves of her Balenciaga suit, multi-award-winning actress Nicole Kidman looks me dead in the eye and, with great relish, delivers one of her most iconic lines: “Heartbreak feels good in a place like this.” In case you’ve been living under a rock, or haven’t been to the movies in the last few years, that quote is from a spot Kidman filmed for AMC Theatres at the height of the pandemic. It’s a simple 60-second ad, and yet, from the moment of its release in September 2021, it became the stuff of legend. People stand and salute when it plays in theaters. The internet overflows with homemade “Nicole Kidman for AMC” merch. Sotheby’s recently auctioned off the pinstriped Michael Kors Collection suit worn in the campaign for $9,525. While not every actor enjoys becoming a meme, Kidman has loved every second of it, including the growing trend of drag queens spoofing the AMC ad in their performances. “My dream will be to be onstage doing it with a drag queen,” she says. “I’ve got to be able to do that at some point.”  That the campaign went mega-viral, to Kidman, is kismet: She filmed it over one weekend while working on the movie Being the Ricardos, recruiting the film’s DP, Jeff Cronenweth, and her friend, Oscar-winning screenwriter Billy Ray, to make it happen. She felt it was her duty to answer AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron’s call to help get people back into movie seats. “It was just the desire to keep cinemas alive,” Kidman says. “I’ve had the best experiences in cinema. I’d pretend I was going to school; I’d forge a note, and I’d go and sit in a movie theater. That’s a safe haven for me, so the idea of those not existing—that’s just not part of the equation in my lifetime.” So being memed, getting the SNL treatment, having Jimmy Kimmel crack jokes about it onstage at the 2023 Oscars—it’s all worth it to Kidman. “If that’s what it takes, I’ll do whatever it takes,” she says with a laugh. “We have to have some more ideas for the next one.”   This, ultimately, is the biggest through line of Kidman’s long and illustrious career, the magic that she brings to every project and every set: community. She loves connecting people—especially women. In 2017, she made a very public pledge at a press conference during the Cannes Film Festival that she would work with a female director every 18 months. It came partially from a crisis plaguing Hollywood—she cited the statistic that only 4.2 percent of the top films in 2016 had been directed by women—but also from a very personal place. “There’s a lot of talk, but I need to do; I’m a doer. I also just love women,” Kidman says. “I’m surrounded by great women and I understand all the aspects of different women, because we have so many women in our family. I feel very, very safe and very at home.” From Sofia Coppola’s film The Beguiled to the HBO miniseries The Undoing, directed by Susanne Bier, it’s clear Kidman has more than made good on that promise, not merely working with female directors and creators, but also championing them and throwing her star power behind their work. When it came time to find a partner for the Amazon series Expats, which Kidman co–executive produced, the actress approached writer and director Lulu Wang. Like the rest of Hollywood, Kidman was dazzled by Wang’s second feature film, The Farewell, and knew she could bring something special to the story. “She really believes in a singular vision, and I know from the work that she’s chosen to do as an actor for her whole career, she really believes in directors and in taking risks, and she convinced me of that,” says Wang, who directed every episode and was one of five writers on the project—all women. “She said, ‘I don’t want it to be anything other than your vision. That’s why I came to you, and whatever you feel that you’ll need, I’ll make sure that it happens.’” Expats is something of a full-circle moment for Kidman and her production company Blossom Films, which launched with the 2010 movie Rabbit Hole. Both are stories about women grief-stricken over the loss of a child. But where Rabbit Hole’s Becca had a sense of closure following the death of her son, Expats’ Margaret is agonized by the fact that her son has gone missing in a Hong Kong night market. It wasn’t an easy role to carry around for months of filming, especially as a mother, but Kidman felt a deep compassion for Margaret. “She will not give up hope, which was probably the thing I related to—that desire to go, ‘No, I know deep down, my child is out there and I’ll find my child,’” Kidman says of her Expats character. “She’s got this dogged refusal to accept anyone that tells her differently. She just won’t stop. And that’s what I think I empathized with.” In one of the most striking scenes of the series, Margaret and her husband Clarke (played by Brian Tee) visit a morgue to view a body that matches the description of their son. Facing the body bag, Margaret starts laughing and finds herself unable to stop. Kidman made the suggestion based on her own experience viewing her father in his coffin. “I literally started laughing because I was so grief-stricken and so devastated. My body and my psyche just couldn’t handle it,” she says. “Even at other times in my life, I’ve laughed at inappropriate times because I have this weird short-circuiting. It’s like you need this moment to keep you alive, in a way, otherwise you’ll die. It’s too much pain.”  Expats required emotional work that could be daunting for some actors, but is the kind of material Kidman is drawn to. “I’m fortunate that I’ve got a job where I get to explore emotional landscapes that are heavy, strange, extraordinary, bizarre, beautiful, deep,” she says. “I don’t shy away from them, partly because I’m committed to examining life, what it means to be alive and feel.” Thankfully, Kidman has her family to fall back on and support her. In Dave Karger’s new book 50 Oscar Nights, Kidman admitted that she was “struggling” with her personal life when she won her sole Academy Award in 2003. “I haven’t won an Oscar when I wasn’t lonely,” she says frankly, but “I’ve been nominated since winning, and for me, it’s very much about the family, whether it be my mother, my husband, my kids.” With husband Keith Urban and their two daughters, Sunday and Faith, in her corner, the personal joy makes the professional success that much better. “There’s something about it where you go, ‘Oh look, I earned this for the family,’” she says. “That makes it fun. That gives it meaning and gives it a joy.” The four have a home in Tennessee, away from the bustling coasts, and Kidman and Urban are an active part of that community, from visiting children’s hospitals to running out to buy diapers for the school donation drive. “I like being a part of something not about my work, not about who I am, none of that. Just a citizen who’s in the world. And my kids love that, too, when I do that,” she says.  Kidman, who has felt connected to breast cancer causes ever since her own mother was treated for the disease when the actress was a teenager, has helped raise millions of dollars to support research by the Women’s Cancer Program at Stanford over the years. She has also helped fund two crucial studies at Nashville’s Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, and even visits patients there when she can. She reads medical journals as well. “It’s always struck me that she doesn’t just come in and say that she wants to make a donation. She wants to understand what she’s doing and how she can have an impact,” says Vandana Abramson, MD, a coleader of the center’s Breast Cancer Research Program who has become close friends with Kidman. “How many questions she’s asked about the science speaks volumes about who she is.” In addition to her work with breast cancer research, Kidman has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN since 2006. As part of that work, she supported UN Women’s Say NO–UNiTE to End Violence Against Women initiative, doing more than merely throwing her name behind the cause. In 2020, as cases of intimate partner abuse spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kidman reached out to UN Women to ask what she could do to help. The result was an op-ed she wrote for the Guardian, as well as a widely viewed video that raised awareness of support services. Her relationship with the UN goes back nearly 20 years, but for Kidman, developing those deep roots is crucial to doing the work. “I’d love to be able to do it all, and I’ve got to be careful how much I commit to so I can do it properly, because the idea of not doing it properly—that’s not a good feeling,” she explains. Much of what Kidman does these days is tied to her two daughters with Urban, the youngest of her four children. They’ve traveled the world with their parents, whether living on location with their actor mom or touring with their musician dad. And when they’re home, Kidman loves that their house is where all the girls’ friends gather. “I love teenage girls. I just find them exquisite,” she says. “I marvel at that age group and what they’re dealing with, but also their ability to handle so much.” Her daughter Sunday, by the way, is at least partially responsible for Big Little Lies getting a third season. “My daughter is the one who watched both of the series and went, ‘Okay, there’s just no question, there has to be a third,’” she says, adding with a laugh that her daughter even gives notes on character development. “She’s like, ‘Celeste, she’s not coping in the second one, what is she doing? I could kind of see the point of view of Mary Louise.’”  Kidman confirms that she and Reese Witherspoon have been texting about the third season, both feeling the timing is right to revisit their characters. “There’s the richness of the storylines, which we’d always discussed, but it needed time because there’s actual unbelievable depth to the next chapter of these women’s lives and their children’s lives—because children grow up, and that’s kind of fascinating,” Kidman says.  She also says that there’s even a timeline in place for making it happen with the rest of the cast—which she cheekily declines to share. The Big Little Lies costars are in big demand, and it’s daunting to consider lining up those A-list calendars, but Kidman says the real friendships they’ve built with each other on set make it easy. “I think when you’re all scattered and never sort of cross paths, it’s very, very different. But when you’re all still very intertwined, that’s what makes it doable, because there’s a willingness and you want to spend time together,” she says.  There’s no question this life has been glamorous for Kidman. It’s the night of the Expats premiere in New York City, so when we part ways, she’s whisked back to her hotel room, where she’ll be zipped up into a sexy, skin-baring gown from Atelier Versace, a slinky black number with an acid-green silk-satin lining. But as much fun as she has playing with fashion and working with brands like Balenciaga, which recently named her an ambassador, she’s also more than happy to skip the after-parties. “It feels a little unreal at times. I want to get out, take my dress off, and put my jammies on. It’s kind of like the opposite of Cinderella—I’m happy to go home and just go back to me,” she admits. “It does feel a little overwhelming. I’m like, ‘I need to go home now. I’m very tired. I want to get warm, and I want to curl up, and I want to feel real.’” The real Kidman, she says, is someone who puts the Christmas lights up way too early. She’s an oldest child who is still working on her tendency toward people-pleasing. She throws big New Year’s Eve blowouts with her husband, who loves that holiday, and regularly hosts parties for her daughters’ friends, too. In other words, it’s her community that makes her real. “I have a very full life with people that I love. I’m raising daughters. I’m a wife, I’m a best friend. I’m a sister, I’m an aunt. I have deeply intimate relationships with people. And that, to me, is the meaning of life—and then taking care of what we leave behind, who we leave behind and how we do that, and our sense of respect for that.” Hair by Tomo Jidai and makeup by Frank B, both at Home Agency; manicure by Alicia Torello for Chanel; set design by Philipp Haemmerle; produced by Mario Sorrenti Studio.

              " 'Sen. Tammy Baldwin has made LGBTQ+ history multiple times throughout her political career. In 1998, she became the first openly LGBTQ+ non-incumbent to be elected to the House of Representatives. And in 2012, she became the first openly LGBTQ+ person to be elected to the Senate.   Now, with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Sen. Laphonza Butler both not running for reelection, Baldwin could become the only openly LGBTQ+ person in the Senate next term—if she’s reelected this November.  This Pride Month, ELLE.com spoke to Baldwin about her trailblazing career, political leadership on crucial LGBTQ+ issues, and high-profile Senate race, as Wisconsin is seen as one of the crucial swing states that will decide control of the Senate and the White House. “I’m a strong believer that a seat at the table matters, that we’re better governed when we have legislatures that reflect the composition of the U.S. and our constituencies,” Baldwin tells ELLE.com. “There’s an old expression that if you’re not in the room, the conversation’s about you, but if you’re in the room, the conversation is with you.” Below, the senator and candidate goes deep on representation, legislation, and her own determination. It became an urgent priority in the wake of the Dobbs decision. Overturning Roe v. Wade took away rights and freedoms from half of all Americans, so that they had fewer than their parents and grandparents. I read the opinion, and it basically said Roe was wrongly decided in the first place, because there is no right to privacy. And then I thought of all the cases I’d studied in law school that were based on a right to privacy. That included interracial marriage, access to contraception, the Lawrence decision, which relates to intimate conduct between consenting adults, and Obergefell, the same-sex marriage case. I started immediately hearing from people who were terrified that their marriages would not be recognized in the future.  So we introduced the Respect for Marriage Act, but the scuttlebutt was, think about how divided our times are, how divided the Congress is, how divided our country is. You don’t really think you can pass the Respect for Marriage Act, do you? And I was like, “Just watch.” I remember having conversations, one after another, with Republican colleagues who I felt wanted to get to [voting] “yes” but didn’t know how. There were concerns raised about how this would affect religious liberties in the U.S., and we were trying to press the point that it doesn’t expand or contract religious liberties. It simply is an insurance policy that should this Supreme Court overturn Loving [which ruled that laws that ban interracial marriages are unconstitutional] or Obergefell [which guaranteed the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples] that marriages that have been legally entered into will continue to be recognized by the federal government in all 50 states. Literally, it was one by one, and we got, in the end, 12 Republicans to join all 50 Democrats at the time to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. But it took weeks, and a lot of negotiation.  Ultimately, the reason we prevailed is that we were vocal and visible. There wasn’t a Republican who I was negotiating with that didn’t know somebody, or have somebody in their extended family, or a staff member, or somebody they went to church with who was married [and could potentially be affected]. They got it.  One of the reasons that I felt we were able to make such headway on the Respect for Marriage Act in the wake of the Dobbs decision was that all the conversations that’d been going on prior to Dobbs were about the Equality Act. I had been meeting with a number of my Republican colleagues who had not signed on to the Equality Act, thinking, “What are their concerns? Why are they not signing on? How can we address any concerns or clarifications?”  One of the things that was heartening about those conversations was that people were very supportive of the employment provisions and the housing provisions. Where we began to encounter opposition and concern was around some of the provisions related to public accommodations and education. And you’re seeing those battles play out in real-time. You can point to the “bathroom battles,” and the other discriminatory legislation that we’re seeing emerge at the state and local level.  This is a time where there’s been a backlash to our progress, and in terms of being an informed voter, look where people stood on the Respect for Marriage Act. Look how they’re coming down on these initiatives at the state and local level. It’s really, really critical that we elect pro-equality candidates up and down the ballot. Well, I’m a strong believer that a seat at the table matters, that we’re better governed when we have legislatures that reflect the composition of the U.S. and our constituencies. There’s an old expression that if you’re not in the room, the conversation’s about you, but if you’re in the room, the conversation is with you. I really believe in that.  When I first ran for office back in 1986 for the Dane County Board of Supervisors and was elected, there were only a couple dozen openly gay or lesbian elected officials in the world. I know because we convened. I participated in 1986 in an early convening of out gay or lesbian elected officials, and there were less than two dozen of us who attended. I think we’re over a thousand now [in the U.S.].  So over the course of a few decades, we’ve seen our numbers grow. We’ve seen every state elect out LGBTQ individuals to some level of office. All of that’s very promising, but again, the seat at the table is so critical to making sure that our voices are heard, our concerns are raised, our challenges are acknowledged. We have a long way to go in terms of parity with regard to representation for sure.  One of the other things I’ve observed over that time is how we’re role models. It’s hard to see yourself, say, in office or in a leadership role, without having seen somebody like you do it. And so the fact that there are more and more of us in the U.S. Senate and Congress, in state legislatures, and now also governors, it’s  powerful. It’s powerful for young folks who come after to say, “I can aspire to doing this, too.” I find that inspiring. We had one of the most gerrymandered states in the country, and the legislature has just adopted a new set of maps for our state legislative districts, our State Assembly, and State Senate seats. So there are new districts, and they’re competitive, and they’re fair. So I am seeing candidates who have long dreamed about serving their community and running for office, but they just never did, because the districts were so lopsided they knew they never would have had a chance of winning. I really think that having fair maps and having contested races for local office is going to bring people out. I think that’s really going to boost participation and boost turnout in a way that’s going to help the top of the ticket, both for my race and the presidential race. I think what’s certainly on the minds of most of the voters I know are what I call the “kitchen table issues,” the “pocketbook” issues. The economy. The cost of things is still weighing on people’s minds when they go to the grocery store, when they go to the gas station. The fact that the inflation that we saw some years back has not dissipated. It weighs on people, and they worry about getting by. Beyond that, some of the issues we were just talking about, that we’ve lost rights and freedoms in the United States. I always think of our country as one where we keep moving forward, where we keep on winning new rights and freedoms, as we have historically for the LGBTQ community, but also with regard to reproductive freedoms. Now we’re at a moment in America where we’re seeing a retreat. We’re going backwards. So I have talked to a lot of folks in Wisconsin for whom winning back reproductive freedoms is a critical issue. Showing up matters. I travel Wisconsin tirelessly to try to go to places where people aren’t used to seeing a U.S. senator. I’ll get people saying, “I can’t remember the last time we had a U.S. senator in these parts, especially not a Democrat.” Showing up matters, and listening to people where they’re at matters. You figure out very quickly there’s a lot more that unites us than divides us. When people share their challenges and see me go back to Washington and start working on helping them overcome those, I think that’s recognized. I get credit from voters. Even if they’re voters who are typically Republican voters. They see, well, she showed up, and she listened, and she’s working on our behalf. That matters to people.

Aquarius risings are like a wise breath of fresh air, known as the trailblazers of the cosmos. Whether you are an Aquarius rising or curious about one in your life, explore their unique traits and the impact of this ascendant on friendships, love, finances, and professional pursuits, below. Astrology, the ancient metaphysical study of the cosmos and its influence on human existence, delves deeper than just your sun sign—popularly known as your zodiac sign and determined by your birth month and date. While your sun sign represents your core self, there’s another celestial layer to who you are: the rising sign, also known by astrologers as the ascendant. The rising sign shapes how you appear to the world, impacting the initial impressions you make, and influencing your interactions with others. Your rising sign, determined by your birth date, time, and location, changes approximately every two hours and can be found using a free birth chart calculator. Technically speaking, it’s the zodiac sign that was ascending (or rising) on the eastern horizon at the moment of your birth. It also sets the stage for the structure of the 12 houses in your astrological chart and highlights a particular planet (or planets) as your chart ruler. For Aquarius ascendants, those planets are the stern and structured Saturn and Uranus, giving them a unique blend of eccentricity and innovation. Aquarius risings are born with the 11th sign of the zodiac on their ascendant. Ruled by both Saturn and Uranus, their role in the zodiac is to be the disrupters, breaking through the boundaries of time and tradition. Symbolized by the Water Bearer, who is pictured pouring out wisdom to the collective, Aquarius is a fixed air sign known for original thinking, humanitarian ideals, and a penchant for disrupting the status quo.  Those with an Aquarius rising are here to challenge what society deems as “normal” and bring about change in the world. They embody an intriguing blend of open-mindedness and progressiveness, all while maintaining an unemotional composure that can sometimes come across as aloofness. They may be forward thinkers with opinions, but their fixed, rigid nature can also come across as stubborn and dogmatic, if they are not careful. While they have a natural love for collective humanity, you may think an Aquarius rising doesn’t like you when you initially meet. Don’t take it personally; this airy detachment is their way of understanding and processing the world around them. Aquarius risings are often seen as unconventional and may have a rebellious streak, always willing to push the boundaries of tradition and explore new ideas. As they become older, Aquarius risings typically cultivate a profound sense of self-acceptance and a genuine appreciation for their distinctive qualities. This transformation often unfolds during their Saturn return, a significant astrological milestone that occurs around the ages of 27 to 30. In their earlier years, they frequently struggle with not feeling understood or embraced by others, a journey that can present its own set of obstacles and challenges. Famous Aquarius risings include Barack Obama, Nicki Minaj, Christina Aguilera, Zendaya, Audrey Hepburn, Khloé Kardashian, Orlando Bloom, SZA, and Adam Driver. The rising sign not only affects your persona, it also strongly influences your physical appearance and the first impression you make on others. For Aquarius risings, they’re initially perceived as unique and nonconforming. Their look can be striking, and they often stand out from the crowd. Their eyes, in particular, are captivating and friendly, often reflecting their deep curiosity and intellect. While they can come across more stoic and eccentric due to the Saturnian and Uranian influences on their ascendant (remember: their planetary rulers), Aquarius risings move through life with ease and grace, not caring about societal norms. They tend to have a distinctive sense of style and may gravitate toward unorthodox or avant-garde fashion choices. They tend to embrace trends long before they become widely accepted as cool or fashionable by the masses. Aquarius risings’ progressive and intellectual nature aligns well with other Aquarians and fellow air signs, Gemini and Libra. This is due to their cerebral nature, detached emotions, shared intellectual interests, and a love for engaging in thought-provoking conversations. They also find compatibility with fire signs like Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, who share their enthusiasm for adventure and exploration. Air tends to fuel the flames of a fire sign’s passion, creating a dynamite combination. On the other hand, Aquarius risings may face challenges in relationships with earth and water signs: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. These signs often exhibit a more traditional, grounded, and emotionally intense approach to life, which can clash with an Aquarius ascendant’s experimental and impassive perspective. However, with mutual understanding and communication, these differences can be bridged. Aquarius risings are true trailblazers who love to make surface-level acquaintances and connections all over the world. They are drawn to individuals who share their passion for transformation and innovation. Their friends often describe them as the “idea person” in the group, always coming up with new concepts and creative solutions to problems. While collecting connections is their passion, diving too deep into your personal problems or emotions isn’t really their cup of tea. Aquarius ascendants value their independence and respect the freedom of their friends. They are known for being supportive of their friends’ pursuits and will always encourage them to chase their dreams. These individuals thrive in social circles that embrace diversity and value intellectual growth. When it comes to matters of the heart, Aquarius rising brings an air of detachment and individuality to their relationships. They are not afraid to challenge norms in love and may be attracted to partners who share their progressive values. These individuals appreciate a sense of freedom in their relationships and are open to exploring new and unconventional forms of partnership. Aquarius ascendants are most attracted to partners who are creatively expressive, bringing fun and romance into their world. This dynamic can be compared to an entertainer onstage (their partner) and the appreciative audience (Aquarius) receiving the performance. Aquarius risings can be loyal and devoted partners, but they need a partner who understands and respects their need for personal space. They are also attracted to people who are intellectually stimulating and share their passion for social justice. In love, they seek a deep emotional connection while still maintaining their individuality. Aquarius risings are often drawn to financial endeavors that align with their values. These individuals may invest in fields such as technology, social activism, or novel start-ups. They are not typically motivated by material wealth, but they do appreciate financial stability, as it provides them with the freedom to pursue their passions and make a difference in society. They are willing to take calculated risks when it comes to investments, often seeking opportunities with the potential to create positive change. However, it’s important to note that certain Aquarius ascendants may find themselves devoting a substantial portion of their finances and resources to their humanitarian endeavors, at times resulting in personal loss and financial instability. Unchecked self-sacrifice can ultimately end up hurting them, if they’re not careful. In terms of their private home and family life, Aquarius ascendants often prioritize creating a harmonious, safe, and comfortable domestic environment. Aquarius risings have a deep appreciation for the stability and security that their home offers and take great care in making it a haven of tranquility. Their living spaces reflect a blend of practicality and aesthetics, and they are inclined to invest in quality and enduring furnishings. They often infuse their unique aesthetic tastes with plant life and their favorite four-legged friends. In the realm of family dynamics, Aquarius risings may have a particularly close bond with their mother, while their relationship with their father can sometimes be emotionally distant. This is due to the Saturnian influence on their natal chart. Therefore, as an adult, they feel driven to provide the nurturing they may not have received. However, it’s crucial to note that these dynamics can vary widely depending on the individual’s unique birth chart, where planetary placements and aspects play a significant role in shaping their familial connections. Aquarius risings’ unique and future-oriented vision also shines through in their career and professional lives. While they don’t wear their emotions on their sleeve, their vocation is often one that brings depth, transformation, and profound change to the world. They are natural leaders who excel in careers that involve pushing boundaries and challenging the norm. These ascendants thrive in fields related to technology, science, social activism, and humanitarian work. They also may be interested in the occult, astrology, psychotherapy, and metaphysics. Aquarius rising professionals are often at the forefront of transformative social movements and life-altering research, using their unique perspective and fresh ideas to make a positive impact. They have a talent for identifying and creating trends and developing new systems, which gives them a competitive edge in their chosen career paths. Although others may take some time to comprehend their vision, Aquarius risings remain steadfast. As they persist, the world gradually evolves and begins to embrace their distinctive ideas.

Whether you are a Sagittarius rising or simply intrigued by someone who is, read on to discover the adventurous spirit that this fortunate ascendant brings to the world. While many people are familiar with their sun sign (also popularly called your zodiac sign), which represents  your core ego and self, there’s another layer to this celestial puzzle: the rising sign, also called the ascendant. The rising sign influences the way we appear to others and the initial impressions we make, playing a significant role in shaping our interactions and relationships. Your rising sign offers insight into how you perceive the external world, your outward personality, and the immediate impression you leave on others. It’s also why you may not feel entirely like your sun sign. Changing approximately every two hours, your rising sign is determined by your birth date, location, and precise birth time, and you can discover yours using a free birth chart calculator. It’s technically the zodiac sign that was ascending (rising) on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth. It also establishes the structure of the 12 houses in your astrological chart and informs the planet that holds special significance for your ascendant. For a Sagittarius rising, expansive and lucky Jupiter rules over their chart. Sagittarius risings are born with the aforementioned ninth sign of the zodiac on their ascendant, making lucky Jupiter their ruling planet. Their symbol is the Archer, pointing his arrow at the boundless and infinite sky. This gives them a vibe of optimism, adventure, and a thirst for knowledge. Sagittarius is a freedom-loving mutable fire sign, symbolizing enthusiasm and a passion for ideas and exploration. Those with a Sagittarius ascendant are always seeking to expand their horizons. These fiery folks are known for their open-mindedness, love of travel, and innate curiosity that drives them to seek new cultures, beliefs, and experiences. With a sunny disposition on the surface, they have a strong sense of personal values and can come across quite dogmatic when left unchecked. Sagittarius risings are eager, lively, and always ready for a new challenge. Famous Sagittarius risings include Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton, Oprah Winfrey, Princess Diana, Scarlett Johansson, Jodie Foster, and Jennifer Lawrence. The rising sign strongly influences physical appearance, as it represents the mask you wear when you first meet someone or enter a new social situation. Sagittarius risings often have a bright and open aura, an animated smile, and eyes that radiate positivity regardless of what emotions may be brewing beneath the surface. Their physical features are typically lively and expressive. These fiery individuals have an inherent sense of style that leans toward the eclectic and unconventional. They’re the first in line at local artisanal shops to purchase unique clothing during all of their travels around the world. Sagittarius ascendants embrace fashion that allows them to express their individuality and cultural diversity. On the other hand, some may often have an athletic or active look, as they are inclined to enjoy physical activities—ready at a moment’s notice for an adventure. Sagittarius ascendants’ adventurous and approachable nature aligns well with other fire sign ascendants, like fellow Sagittarians, Aries, and Leos, as they share a passion for excitement and a positive disposition. Additionally, their love for exploration and intellectual pursuits creates a harmonious connection with air signs: Libra, Gemini, and Aquarius. Sagittarius risings often feel satisfied with how air signs fuel their curiosity about the world. On the other hand, Sagittarius risings may encounter hurdles in relationships with earth and water ascendants: Taurus, Capricorn, Virgo, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. These signs tend to have different temperaments and priorities, which can lead to clashes, if not handled with patience and understanding. Earth’s need for stability and structure can feel stifling to their need for independence, while the sensitivity of water can douse Sagittarius’ enterprising flames. However, differences can also provide opportunities for growth and learning in relationships. In the realm of friendships, Sagittarius risings are fun and adventurous companions. They are always up for finding new places, trying different activities, and embarking on spontaneous voyages. Their open-mindedness and sense of humor make them great friends who can liven up any social gathering. They prioritize peace and harmony when it comes to their platonic connections, shying away from uncomfortable and negative conflict. Sagittarius ascendants also have a knack for bringing people together and fostering a sense of communal joy. They enjoy organizing group trips, retreats, outdoor activities, and cultural experiences that allow them to learn and grow alongside their friends. These individuals value having a safe space to be themselves in their friendships and appreciate those who share their love for exploration and personal growth. In love, romance, and long-term relationships, Sagittarius risings crave spontaneity. They are not ones to rush into commitment, but rather seek partners who share their appreciation for personal growth, while still prioritizing freedom and independence.  Romance for a Sagittarius rising is often filled with excitement and novelty at first. They enjoy going on getaways and engaging in intellectually stimulating conversations with their partners. However, they can be commitment-phobic at times. Stifling bonds send them running for the hills! It’s essential for their partners to understand and respect this need, while also fostering a deep emotional connection. While Sagittarius risings may not make material wealth their primary focus, they tend to be hopeful about their financial prospects. They often find themselves on a transformative financial journey filled with valuable lessons and challenges. While their love for adventure may guide them toward exciting monetary opportunities, they also must learn the importance of disciplined financial management due to their tendency to overspend. Through financial setbacks or lessons in resourcefulness, they gradually develop a more responsible approach to money matters with age. Sagittarius ascendants come to understand that long-term financial security requires patience and a steady commitment to their goals. They may go through periods of trial and error, but each challenge serves as a stepping stone toward greater financial success. As they navigate this adult side of life, Sagittarius risings discover how to balance their adventurous spirit with the need for stability, ultimately forging a path toward a more secure and prosperous future. Sagittarius risings bring a unique blend of cheer, compassion, and dreaminess to their domestic life. Their homes often are private sanctuaries of creativity and spiritual connection, where they can express their imaginative and sensitive sides that they don’t often show to the rest of the world. While incredibly social, Sagittarius ascendants love to spend time in hermit mode in order to restore themselves emotionally. They have a deep appreciation for art, music, and spiritual practices, and they infuse their homes with a serene and mystical atmosphere. They may frequently engage in activities like meditation, yoga, or other forms of holistic healing within the comfort of their own abode. This ascendant’s family life is marked by deep empathy and sensitivity, making them incredibly attuned to the emotional needs of their family members. However, this heightened emotional sensitivity can also be rooted in their past experiences, as they may have dealt with the loss of a significant family member in their early life or experienced abrupt changes within their home environment. These experiences have made them acutely aware of the importance of family time. In their professional lives, Sagittarius risings shine as natural teachers and philosophers. They thrive in careers that allow them to travel, learn, and share their knowledge with others. These individuals are drawn to fields such as education, journalism, publishing, politics, law, business, spirituality, and travel-related industries. Their confident and adventurous spirit makes them excellent entrepreneurs and risk-takers, always willing to embark on new ventures and investigate uncharted territory. Sagittarius risings are often recognized for their wisdom, enthusiasm, and ability to inspire others. They also have a natural talent for bridging cultural divides and bringing people together through their work.

Look out: As the first zodiac sign to kick off the astrological new year, when Aries is ascending, you can be sure to expect fireworks. Aries risings bring a dynamic and fearless energy to the world, and their assertive and adventurous spirit makes them natural leaders and trendsetters. Below, explore all their fiery traits. While many already know about the ever-so-popular sun sign (representing the core self and identified by birth month and day), there’s a lot more to one’s astrological story. Introducing: the rising sign, also called the ascendant. Your rising sign shapes your interactions with the outside world, your personality, and how you appear to others. It’s the mask we wear in new social situations, influencing others’ immediate impressions of us. Your rising sign is determined by your birth date, location, and, most importantly, your accurate birth time, as the rising sign changes zodiac signs approximately every two hours. Technically speaking, it’s the zodiac sign that was rising or ascending on the eastern horizon the moment you were born. To identify your rising sign, you can use a free birth chart calculator. The rising sign also sets up the pie-shaped structure of the 12 houses in your birth chart and informs your chart ruler. For Aries risings, that ruler is Mars, the archetypal god of war. As mentioned, Aries risings are born with the first sign of the zodiac on their ascendant, making Mars their ruling planet and an important part of their natal chart. As a zodiac sign, Aries are all about drive, action, raw sexuality, impulsivity, and confident zeal. The result: They have a natural assertiveness and passionate air about them. Aries is a cardinal fire sign symbolized by the sturdy Ram, giving a pioneering spirit. They are often seen as fearless leaders who aren’t afraid to take risks and blaze new trails. Aries ascendants also tend to have a strong sense of self, feeling most aligned when they are in control of their own destiny. They come across as independent and self-reliant, which can also sometimes be interpreted as self-centeredness. Aries risings are also known for their boundless enthusiasm and competitive nature. They approach life with a “can-do” attitude and are always ready to tackle challenges head-on, just like the Ram. Famous Aries risings include Penélope Cruz, Kendall Jenner, Barbra Streisand, Shakira, Joan Rivers, and Rihanna. The rising sign in astrology strongly influences physical appearance, and for Aries risings, this translates into sharp and distinctive facial features. They often have a strong and confident posture, as well as a vibrant, optimistic, and lively demeanor. Aries risings also possess a charisma that attracts others, enabling them to take charge in groups effortlessly. They love to be physically active and need movement as an outlet. Their eyes are often bright and intense, and they move with purpose and enthusiasm, displaying a sense of urgency in their actions. Aries risings are not afraid to make bold fashion statements; instead of adhering to trends, they create them. Aries ascendants tend to align well with other Aries and fellow fire sign ascendants, like Leo and Sagittarius. These signs share a zest for life and a desire for adventure. Additionally, Aries risings also find compatibility with air signs: Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. Their intellectual and relational qualities fuel the flames of their fire. On the other hand, Aries risings may encounter challenges in relationships with earth and water ascendants: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. They often have different approaches to life, which can create friction and require effort and adjustment on both sides of the relationship. Earth risings can feel limiting and uneventful, while water risings’ intense emotional depth can douse the hot fire of an Aries ascendant. While differences can add  to relationships, they can also cause conflicts if not managed with understanding and compromise. Aries ascendants tend to have friends from diverse walks of life, effortlessly creating connections no matter where their journeys take them across the globe. Their charisma and friendliness is contagious, attracting people easily; Aries risings will strike up a conversation with just about anyone. They are lively, free-spirited, and adventurous companions—always up for exciting and spontaneous activities, making them the go-to friend for impromptu experiences. If you’re looking for a fun-filled time, Aries risings are it. Aries tend to be around for a good time—not a long time—for acquaintances or loose connections, but if you’re a close friend, they will always stand beside you, offering their steady support. They may not be inclined to immerse themselves in the emotions surrounding your challenges, but their loyalty remains unwavering. One other challenge in friendships is their forceful nature, as they may be perceived as too dominant or competitive. Nevertheless, their natural excitement makes them fabulous companions and friends. When it comes to matters of the heart, Aries risings bring fervor and a sense of adventure. They pursue their romantic interests with gusto, and the physical act of sex is also quite important for them. Aries risings are known for their intense love affairs, and they thrive in relationships that offer pleasure, excitement, and novelty. They’re also the type to take the reins in planning dates and romantic outings, though they’ll always leave room for spontaneity, fun, and pleasure. They often have vibrant love lives and enjoy making the first move. Nevertheless, these individuals are independent and value their freedom, so they may be hesitant to commit fully at first. However, once they do commit, they are loyal partners who will do whatever it takes to make the relationship work. They love those who can bring harmony, balance, and cohesion, and may suddenly ghost if this need is met with conflict. This can create challenges in sustaining long-term relationships for some Aries ascendants. No one is perfect, and sometimes you can agree to disagree. Financial stability is essential for Aries risings, and they are persistent when it comes to their financial goals. They don’t feel personally fulfilled, safe, and secure when they don’t have the means to indulge in all that life has to offer, whether it be food, luxury items, or travel, and they will work hard to accumulate the means to feed their material needs. They also must balance their spontaneous and risk-taking nature with a practical and grounded approach to finances. Aries ascendants enjoy the thrill of acquiring new possessions, diving into risky yet rewarding investment opportunities, and renegotiating their worth for more. Their fiery disposition drives them to embrace financial risks and seize said investment opportunities without hesitation. However, they must also pump the brakes at times and weigh risks mindfully to ensure long-term financial stability. Their inclination to overindulge and overspend can pose challenges to their financial well-being in the future. For Aries risings, their home and family typically hold significant emotional importance, for better or worse—especially their relationship with their mother. They seek a nurturing and secure environment in their homes, valuing family traditions and creating a warm, loving atmosphere. As caregivers within the family, they are deeply protective and empathetic, always ready to provide emotional support. Their connection to their roots and heritage is strong, fostering a sense of nostalgia and a desire to explore their family’s history. These individuals bring a nurturing and emotionally sensitive energy to their home and family life, cherishing the bonds they share with their loved ones and embracing their role as emotional anchors within the family. Professionally, Aries risings care about what they do and are driven by a desire to make an impact in their chosen fields. They tend to thrive in careers that allow them to be active, indulge in their passions, be at the forefront, and make decisions for the team. They are natural leaders who excel in positions of authority and responsibility. Aries risings can excel and enjoy the stability offered within hierarchical organizations, such as corporations. However, for them to feel fulfilled and avoid a sense of suffocation, they typically thrive when placed at the top of the authority ladder. Their courageous approach to life’s challenges also makes them well-suited for roles that require action and initiative. These individuals often excel in competitive fields such as business, law, sports, the armed forces, entrepreneurship, and management. They are not afraid to take risks and are willing to push boundaries to achieve their goals.

Here, explore how their rising sign influences their friendships, love lives, finances, home lives, and careers. So whether you’re a Virgo rising or friends with one, you can gain insight into the discerning and detail-oriented energy this ascendant sign brings to the stars. When it comes to astrology, many people are already familiar with their sun sign, which represents their core self, ego, and life force. However, there’s another essential piece to this celestial puzzle: the rising sign, also known as the ascendant. Your rising sign shapes how you appear to others; it’s the lens through which you perceive the external world, defining your outward personality and shaping the immediate impression you make on others. Your rising sign is defined by astrologers as the zodiac sign that was rising on the eastern horizon the moment of your birth, and it changes approximately every two hours. In order to calculate it, you need your birth date, location, and most crucially, your precise birth time. You can uncover yours using a free birth chart calculator of your choice. Your ascendant is also the angle that starts the layout of the 12 houses in your astrological chart and determines your chart ruler. For Virgo risings, Mercury, the planet of communication and intellect, holds this special significance in their charts. Virgo ascendants’ earthy nature can be described as emotionally reserved and practical. Emotional displays are not their thing, and on the surface, they like to always appear clean, composed, and under control. Virgo, a mutable earth sign, is characterized by this analytical nature and feels most aligned when working with or serving others. Virgo as a zodiac sign is symbolized by the maiden carrying wheat from harvest, an ancient representation of cleanliness and chastity. It’s also associated with the sixth house of work, health, and servitude, which is why Virgo risings often work hard and prudently in order to harvest rewards in life. Virgo ascendants are always striving toward self-improvement and the improvement of others, reflecting their desire for perfection in all aspects of life. These grounded folks are typically known for their attention to detail, meticulousness, and methodical approach to problem-solving. They have a strong sense of duty and are highly reliable and responsible. While their disciplined nature serves them well in many aspects of life, it can sometimes lead to decision paralysis or a tendency to be overly critical of themselves and others. Famous Virgo risings include Steve Jobs, Keanu Reeves, Timothée Chalamet, Emma Watson, Jay-Z, Dolly Parton, Usher, Ryan Reynolds, Bella Hadid, Michael B. Jordan, and Christina Ricci. The rising sign represents the mask you wear when first encountering others or in unfamiliar social situations; it’s essentially how you come off to other people. When Virgo ascendants enter a room, they tend to be more reserved, taking in the crowd around them before overly sharing. They might have a cool demeanor, especially if they don’t know anyone, focused on listening and processing information. Virgo risings tend to have an intentional poise about them and care about proper tailoring, clean lines, and abstaining from trends, even when they go for more flamboyant options. Their wardrobe is intentional, reflecting their preference for quality, even if it costs more. Virgo risings are known for their organized appearance, even if their home or life might be a hot mess behind closed doors. They pay careful attention to grooming, and their hair and clothing are typically impeccably maintained. Virgo rising’s practical nature aligns well with fellow earth ascendants, such as Taurus and Capricorn. They are all grounded in the physical world, focusing on stability and tangible achievements. Virgo risings often find compatibility and special synergy with Scorpio risings, who share an appreciation for discernment and analysis. The other water signs’ emotional waves (looking at you, Pisces and Cancer) also mesh well with Virgo’s steadfast earth. On the flip side, Virgo risings might need to make adjustments when they first meet fire and air ascendants: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Libra, and Gemini. These rising signs often embody a more verbal, external, impulsive, and spontaneous approach to life, which might clash with Virgo’s meticulous, modest approach and need for order. In friendships, Virgo risings are reliable, protective, and loyal. They take friendships seriously and are often the go-to person for advice and support. The communities, organizations, or groups they belong to tend to become like family. Virgo risings listen, curb emotional reactions, and provide solutions. They are the voice of reason in the group, offering authentic perspective. They also tend to attract people who need help, always loving the opportunity to be of service. The key, though, is also learning how to say no. If you want your next group trip to be a success, your Virgo ascendant friend is the best for the task. They pay attention to the details, ensuring everything is well-planned and flows smoothly. While they are not the most spontaneous or care-free with forming new connections, when you get to know them, they are a blast to be around. In matters of the heart, Virgo risings are also practical and methodical. Not one to dive too quickly into a new romance, they approach love with a desire for stability. They prefer to take their time to get to know potential partners, carefully evaluating compatibility and assessing the long-term potential of the relationship. Partners with an emotional nature help balance out this intense logic. These individuals are protective over their time and will only build with someone who is in it for the long haul. However, their tendency to be critical, both of themselves and their partners, can sometimes create challenges in their love lives. Virgo risings might need to learn to balance their desire for perfection with acceptance. Virgo ascendants tend to love the finer things in life, but they’re also willing to put in the work required to afford them. Although they splurge on nicer items, financial stability is also important for Virgo risings. They might be able to monetize their talent or creativity, and they approach money matters with the same precision they apply to other aspects of their lives. They are resourceful and skilled at finding ways to maximize their financial resources and minimize unnecessary expenses. When it comes to investments, they are actually quite reserved and tend to do their research and put their time into ideas that will provide long-term rewards. While Virgo risings appear to be in order on the surface, their home life can be where they let their guard down and express themselves more freely. They prefer a home sanctuary where they can be themselves and have a place for spiritual renewal. Virgo ascendants have a penchant for collecting and adorning their homes with unique items and souvenirs from their travels. They view these possessions as not just decorative but also as potential investment pieces, adding an adventurous touch to their living spaces. In terms of family, Virgo ascendants tend to be the caretakers or the first one to help family members in need, especially during childhood. This might cause them to want to break away from family tradition, and some might end up living far away from their hometown. They are excellent hosts, ensuring that guests feel comfortable. Family gatherings are often meticulously planned and executed, with an emphasis on creating a harmonious and enjoyable atmosphere. When it comes to their career, Virgo risings thrive in dynamic and mentally stimulating roles where they can help others. Although their first impression is more subdued at first, they are talented public speakers, coaches, and communicators. Their strengths also include problem-solving, organization, and developing systems for improvement. Spotting inconsistencies makes them a strong asset to any team. These individuals often pursue professions in fields including, but not limited to, accounting, business, the arts, consulting, coaching, counseling, or health care. Virgo risings might have an affinity for working with small animals, plants, and the natural world. They also can make talented healers in a modality of their choice. Their discerning nature allows them to provide valuable advice and guidance to those in need. Virgo ascendants are driven by a desire to make a positive impact on the world.

              " 'ELLE digital director Claire Stern Milch and David Milch paid tribute to the city where they met as neighbors. ELLE digital director Claire Stern Milch found love right under her own roof. She first encountered her now-husband David Milch, the founder and principal of Green Jacket Ventures, a real estate investment, development, and operating company, in the hallway of their building in downtown Manhattan, and quickly realized they’d both studied on the Columbia University campus six years prior. Because of their shared New York roots and mutual distaste for destination weddings, they wanted to get married close to home—in fact, all the venues they considered were within walking distance of their West Village apartment, two blocks from where they met. The couple wound up with a series of classic locations, including Buddakan, The Standard, High Line, The Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers, and Porchlight, each only a 10-minute walk from the other. They also got lucky with unseasonably warm weather for March. “We wanted to give everyone a very New York wedding,” Claire says, noting that their parents both got married there: hers at the Church Center for the United Nations, his at the Pierre Hotel. For the bride, that meant wearing all local designers (Khaite for the rehearsal dinner, custom Andrew Kwon for the wedding, and Markarian for the after-party), asking Dani Luv from Sammy’s Roumanian Steakhouse to do the hora, and serving Joe’s Pizza at the end of the night. Everything was well-documented, thanks in large part to a content creator, Lauren Ladouceur, who she hired after ELLE published a piece on her.  Above all else, Claire and David’s nuptials celebrated everything they love, from their shared Jewish faith to her affection for Sex and the City.   The rehearsal dinner was held at the large communal table at Buddakan, mirroring the rehearsal dinner scene from the Sex and the City movie. A tasting menu was served, and Claire wore an off-the-shoulder long-sleeved minidress from Khaite and a Rebecca Minkoff leather jacket. David wore a navy blue J.Crew velvet blazer and gray suit pants. “We arrived 15 minutes late so everyone could greet us from the stairwell, just like in the movie,” she says. “As if that’s not corny enough, I asked him for the last single-girl kiss before we left.”   The day of the wedding, the bride got ready with her mother at The Standard, High Line. She had her makeup done by Benoit Dumont from Dior, the artist who typically works with models at the house’s haute couture shows in Paris. Since she doesn’t wear makeup often, “I looked like myself in the best possible way,” Claire says. “He even sprayed my body so it didn’t contrast with my face too much—a true pro.” When designer Andrew Kwon dressed Regina Hall for the 2023 Independent Spirit Awards, Claire wrote about it and became fast friends with him. “We were seated together at the CFDAs last year, and after a couple of vodka sodas, he agreed to make my wedding dress on a very tight timeline,” she says. She was clear on the direction—something that felt both timeless and new—and he fully understood. With a full skirt, strapless corset-style bodice with a mesh back, and sweetheart neckline, it was everything she had envisioned. Her shoes were blue Manolo Blahnik Hangisis, the same style that was memorably used for Mr. Big’s proposal in the film.  For his part, David wore a tuxedo the bride borrowed from Ralph Lauren and Del Toro loafers adorned with tassels. “It was the nicest tuxedo I’ve ever worn,” David says. “Sadly, I had to return it.” The groomsmen wore corresponding Del Toro slippers with suits from The Black Tux. Claire’s bridesmaids wore mismatched dresses by Markarian and pave diamond Stone & Strand initial charm necklaces. Later on, Claire changed into a white sequined Markarian minidress for the after-party and matching Nike Air Force 1s with the groom. The ceremony took place at The Lighthouse just before sunset, and was led by Jed S. Rakoff, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a family friend. Claire and David were impressed by the fact that of the 83 weddings he has officiated, there have only been three divorces. “That’s a pretty good track record,” Claire admits. They were married under a draped chuppah, recited a modernized version of the seven blessings, and sipped Sancerre from a kiddush cup.  “Our officiant really surprised me with his humor—he broke out in song not once, but three times, even chanting the blessings in Hebrew,” David says. On his favorite part, he shares, “Breaking the glass gives the people what they want, that was a lot of fun. Fortunately, I got it on the first try.” The bride’s man of honor, Stefan Doyno, recited a poem from the hit HBO show that Carrie Bradshaw reads during a friend’s wedding at the Plaza.   Claire and her mother worked with florist and event designer Sora Lee of Visions Decor, who, like them, is Korean. She created the chuppah and aesthetic of the room, on top of the flowers, in an all-white palette that was simple, elegant, and understated. “The tea lights hanging from the ceiling on the dance floor were a nice touch,” Claire recalls. “Someone said it felt like we were dancing under the stars.”  Things kicked off at cocktail hour, with Mediterranean and Asian food stations. Dinner, which was catered by The Pier Sixty Collection, began with a Caesar caprese stack, followed by passed granitas on the dance floor. The main course was an option between filet of beef au poivre with charred broccolini and French fries or Mediterranean citrus branzino with grilled polenta, charred endive, lemony broccolini, and crispy sunchokes. The wedding cake was from Billy’s Bakery, the bride’s favorite, and Joe’s Pizza was the surprise late-night snack. Claire and David entered the reception to “New York Groove” by Ace Frehley; they had seen KISS perform on one of their early dates. Claire’s uncle, Mike Choi, took the mic for the first dance, father-daughter dance, and mother-son dance. For their song, the couple chose “The Longest Time” by Billy Joel, and took dance lessons with Simone Assboeck at Dance Together NYC to prepare. “I’m a huge Billy Joel fan and took Claire to see him at Madison Square Garden on Valentine’s Day last year,” David says. “We’ve been listening to him ever since. I harnessed the Strong Island strength to do the lift.”   The father-daughter dance, Claire’s favorite part of any wedding, required her father to break his no-dancing rule. She picked “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley, a song that she feels an attachment to, due to the fact that her mother was living in Jamaica when she met her father. “We travel there at least once a year as a family and are all big Bob Marley fans. That song will forever remind me of my dad—‘everything is gonna be alright’ is a recurring phrase he says to me whenever I’m stressed out, which is often,” Claire says. David and his mother danced to “Solsbury Hill” by Peter Gabriel. Dani Lubnitzki, a.k.a. Dani Luv, the resident lounge singer and pianist for the beloved Lower East Side restaurant Sammy’s Roumanian, which is slated to reopen this month, acted as the one-man klezmer band.   After the impromptu pizza party, guests grabbed gift bags of Clarins lip oils—a subtle riff on the bride’s name—and walked from Chelsea Piers to Porchlight to continue the festivities. The night was capped off with bottles of wine and, of course, Cosmopolitans. A highlight? “I got to control the aux cord,” Claire says.

              " 'Simran Kohli and Vishal Amin brought their closest relatives to witness their marriage at the legendary Amangiri resort. Once Simran Kohli and Vishal Amin decided they would have a small wedding (and one that was very, very small by Indian American standards), they wanted to find a venue that had the same aesthetic as the Utah resort Amangiri. Ultimately, they realized the best example would be Amangiri itself.  “We had visited in the past just as guests, and it stood out to me as the most beautiful place to get married—it’s just so peaceful,” Simran says. “Vishal and I were talking and he was like, ‘Simran, if this is your dream location, why don’t we just pivot and stop trying to find places that are like Amangiri and just do it at Amangiri?’” They planned the wedding, which included only their immediate families, in six weeks and were able to rent the entire property for New Year’s Eve weekend. “I really liked the idea of a New Year’s Eve wedding, because when you’re older, New Year’s Eve is something that you put a lot of effort into finding plans for, and then it usually never lives up to the expectation. So to have your anniversary be New Year’s was pretty attractive to me,” Vishal admits. It should be noted that the bride’s grandparents also got married on December 31. Simran, who is the vice president of Greenlite, a female-owned energy efficiency firm, and Vishal, a managing director at Blackstone, met on Bumble, which Vishal was on the board of. (He notes that their relationship was celebrated as a Bumble success story at Bumble meetings.) There were custom linen napkins embroidered with bumblebees at the reception as a cheeky nod to the app. “While Indian weddings are known for being multi-day grand productions, we wanted to take the opposite approach with an intimate, elegant, family-only elopement at a place that feels overwhelming special, where we could surround ourselves with our loved ones to welcome in this new phase of our lives—and the new year,” Vishal says. It was very important to the couple to take care of their guests (they referenced wanting a “high-touch” experience) and plan private activities for them, like stargazing and a guided tour of Antelope Canyon, for example. They worked with wedding planner Erica Vanco of Estera Events. The wedding weekend included a stop in Las Vegas, big fashion moments, and quality time with their 14 guests. Read on for details. The festivities kicked off at the Wynn Las Vegas, where the couple hosted a dinner at the Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant Wing Lei before hitting the casino. “It was a really fun night to get everybody comfortable with each other at the get-go. Vishal’s dad won $8,000, which was a really good sign. We were all like, ‘This is going to be a great weekend,’” says Simran.  The following day, everyone made the two-hour drive to Amangiri. The couple did the Ganesh Puja, a Hindu wedding ceremony, on the top of Saddle Landing, a remote spot with incredible views. Per tradition, Lord Ganesh is meant to destroy evil and obstacles and the ceremony sets up the couple for a bright new beginning. “It was just the two of us at sunset with Vishal’s priest, who has been with his family for probably 25 years now,” Simran says. Vishal’s grandfather recruited him when he was setting up a temple in Louisville; he now feels like a member of their family. Guests were given monogrammed backpacks filled with gifts personalized for each person. They included Le Labo Laurier 62 candles, which the couple loves, sheet masks, Levain cookies, sunscreen kits from Supergoop (a company that Vishal invests in), Simran’s favorite truffle popcorn, and, for the kids, Legos. It was important to the couple that they spend the morning with each other and get ready together. “I think in an elopement, something that we wanted to be really mindful of is focusing on our relationship,” Simran says. She wore a silk robe, camisole, and pants from Kiki de Montparnasse with Khaite sandals and a pendant with her grandfather’s thumbprint on it.  The couple loves fashion. In Las Vegas, Simran wore a Chanel outfit she’d bought in Capri after getting engaged, and Vishal wore a Ralph Lauren tuxedo. For the first day at Amangiri, Simran wore a sage green Taller Malmo cape dress. “It felt very whimsical for where we were, and very desert-y.” Vishal wore an outfit from the Indian designer Tarun Tahiliani.  For the wedding, she wanted a lehenga that she really felt like herself in. She traveled to India with Vishal’s mother and they visited many designers before deciding to work with Anamika Khanna, who has an east-meets-west style that Simran was drawn to. “I did a handmade lace lehenga that was all cream and ivory, which is quite untraditional for an Indian bride, but I loved it. I worked with them to make it my style. I wanted it to be more tapered and less of a heavy Indian lehenga,” she says. Her jewelry was a stunning emerald set from Narayan Jewellers. That evening, she wore a TOVE Studio gown. Vishal wore an outfit from Sabyasachi for the wedding and a brown Brioni tux. Simran and Vishal adapted elements of Indian wedding rituals. While the groom typically enters first and is taken to the mandap (the altar) before he sits with the bride’s family after a welcoming ceremony, Vishal’s niece served as a flower girl and Simran entered immediately after her. She walked down a pathway that ran from the balcony of her room, through the desert, to the mandap, which has four pillars to represent four stages of life. “I entered in a Western style, despite it being an Indian wedding. Traditionally, Indian brides are fully draped. We didn’t really want to do that. We took elements that we liked. We’re both second- and third-generation Indian, so [we took] things that we liked from Western culture and things that were important to our family and obviously religious [elements], but tried to find a blend of what we felt comfortable with,” Simran says. “I still did a traditional bridal entrance. We did a flower girl and we did cute things at the ceremony.” The couple did the Mangal Phera, a wedding step that has them circle a fire. Vishal led the first three rotations, and Simran led the final one. Each circle symbolizes a life goal. “The tradition is that whoever sits back down first (after the four circles are complete) will be the one in the couple that runs the household in the future,” Simran shares. In the Saptapadi, the couple takes seven steps, each one signifying a marital vow. Simran and Vishal chose to write their own vows.  “We wanted to respect the religious aspects of a Hindu wedding ceremony, but it was through a modern lens that is more representative of our relationship,” she adds. “We really view our relationship as a partnership of two equals sharing in life’s responsibilities and rewards. So, during the Saptapadi, we recited the same vows that we wrote ourselves, whereas usually, women only take specific vows based on traditional gender roles.” During an Indian wedding, the groom will typically give the bride a necklace called a mangalsutra, which is seen as a thread connecting the two. Vishal’s mother created a mangalsutra for the bride using diamonds from the one she received at her own wedding. Simran really wanted the couple’s aesthetic, which skews ethereal, to embrace natural elements, particularly in regards to the mandap. They dreamed of a mandap that was in line with Amangiri’s minimalist look and spoke to the beauty of the desert. “We used local floral elements, woods, hays, boulders, and rocks to feel like the mandap could have always been there, and like our wedding ceremony belonged where it was,” Simran says. The couple worked with florist Sarah Winward to create floral clouds around the structure. Guests sat on boulders instead of chairs, and were given personalized blankets. The reception table featured hundreds of candles that melted throughout the night, creating different shapes. A uniquely curated dinner menu boasted wines brought by the couple and Vishal’s family. “I’m 40, so I think my parents been waiting a long time for me to get married,” Vishal admits. “You end up buying these bottles of wine and they’re like, ‘Oh, we’re going to save this for your wedding.’ Then it ends up being 10 more years, so the wine just gets better.” After dinner, the couple moved to the Desert Lounge, an area of the property meant for events that overlooks the mesas and sand dunes. “We were a little nervous. It was very important for us to have a fun wedding, but when you have such a small wedding, it’s like, okay, well, how do you make it fun? I think people turned up, and we had a DJ and a live violinist,” Vishal says. The night ended with fireworks—a dream come true for the couple. The groom loves the movie Meet Joe Black, and he always envisioned the score from the end as being part of his wedding. “We told them, ‘Hey, this is what we want the fireworks [set] to,’” Vishal says. “It was magical.” Adrienne Gaffney is a features editor at ELLE and previously worked at WSJ Magazine and Vanity Fair.

              " '“We wanted the celebration to be about love and joy, but we also wanted it to just be really easy.” Where else would Megan Pfeiffer and Myles Miller have their wedding other than New York? It’s where they live and met, and where Miller, who works as an on-air reporter for WNBC-TV locally, was raised. “It holds a lot of importance to me and Myles—being in the city we met in, that we found love in, that we live in, that we call our home and our community,” Pfeiffer says. The couple considered many venues, but somehow kept coming back to the Bronx Zoo. Miller had visited there regularly with his grandmother when he was growing up in the area and, shortly before their engagement, the couple took Miller’s niece to see the holiday lights there. “It was just the most magical, spectacular thing I’d ever seen,” recalls Pfeiffer, a senior policy analyst at a national criminal justice nonprofit.  The zoo also served as a source of calm for Miller during the pandemic, when he was working long hours covering the crisis unfolding in New York. “During COVID, it was tough. We were out on the streets working every day, and I would come back home and watch The Zoo on Animal Planet.” Miller loved being able to introduce Pfeiffer’s family to the Bronx. “They got to breathe some of that Bronx air that I’ve breathed my whole life. Megan’s mom and I have a rivalry because she lives in San Diego, and she thinks the San Diego Zoo is the best zoo on earth,” he says. “But I’m from the Bronx, and we have one of the first and best zoos that ever existed. On our wedding night, she got to see how truly amazing the Bronx is.” Incorporating Jewish traditions into the event was important to Pfeiffer, who is Jewish, and Miller as well. “Probably the most special thing that we did, that we actually learned from friends of ours at their wedding, was taking the seven blessings, which are traditionally recited by a rabbi, and putting our own interpretation on them,” she says. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who officiated the ceremony, took a true interest in understanding the Jewish rituals, which Pfeiffer appreciated. “She was like, ‘I really want to learn more about the breaking of the glass. I think that’s such a beautiful, cool tradition. I just want to learn more about it,’” she recalls. Miller’s career in journalism began when he was a child. Before graduating high school, he’d reported on politics for the New York Daily News and served as the youngest ever White House correspondent while working for the News Corp. publication The Daily. Through his work, he frequently runs into government officials who remember him from when he was a kid—including James. “We had just gotten engaged maybe a couple of months before, and I just ran into Tish. I’ve known her since I was maybe 12 years old. I got to know all these politicians because they were like, ‘Oh, look, it’s a kid at the press conference. He’s asking all these questions. Who is this guy?’” he says. “I was like, ‘Tish, did you hear? I’m getting married.’ She’s like, ‘Oh my God, do you want an officiate? I can officiate. I love love.’” The couple wanted to make sure all the members of their families had met prior to the Friday welcome dinner, so on Thursday night, they invited their immediate families to their apartment. “My mom made a ton of food. My dad pitched in with a couple of Jamaican recipes. It’s just weird for the families to meet for the first time at the Friday welcome party,” Miller says. “People walked away thinking, we want to come back to New York and get more of that cooking. My mom threw down.” The wedding weekend started on Friday, when the couple took guests on a walking tour of downtown Brooklyn that passed by the spot where Miller proposed to Pfeiffer. That night, they threw a party at Brooklyn Crab in Red Hook. Dessert was banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery, which Miller frequently brings home from the Rockefeller Center location when he works out of NBC’s headquarters. Before getting ready, Miller went with two close friends and his soon to be father-in-law, brother-in-law, and stepbrother-in-law to the Brooklyn spot Russo’s, where they had gathered only a few months earlier when Pfeiffer’s brother got married. “Megan’s dad is down-to-earth, and he just views me as another one of his sons. We got the exact same sandwiches we ordered last time; we did whiskey toasts. It was funny. The exact same treatment that her brother had, I had, and we had a ball,” Miller says. Pfeiffer was sure she wanted a lace dress, and during a visit to a bridal salon with her mother and sister, she thought she’d found one. But when she heard Miller mention off-hand that he didn’t love a lace dress they’d seen on TV, she decided to look for something different. The next day, she went to Carol Hannah’s bridal showroom. Her sister showed her a dress and said, ‘You should try this on. This is the dress I would try on if I was getting married, and I think it would look really pretty on you.’” Pfeiffer loved how simple and elegant the gown was. “When I put the veil on, my mom started crying. She just felt really emotional. It felt really good. It was a little bit different than what I had thought, but it ended up being perfect,” she says. Pfeiffer and Miller wanted their ketubah, the Jewish marriage contract, to be “an opportunity for us to make commitments to each other about how we’ll show up for each other in marriage and what’s important for us,” Pfeiffer says. They worked to find language that felt egalitarian to them. “We read it before in front of our nearest and dearest, and then signed it. That was really the start of the wedding for us.” During the vows, guests, among them people Miller had met through work like New York City Council Member Gale A. Brewer and New York City Fire Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, saw peacocks and heard roaring lions. Because the wedding was held a week before the zoo’s holiday display opened, all of the lights were up. “I’ll never forget when we met with our DJ, DJ Khaleel of Dapper DJ Productions, he was like, ‘You guys have a lot of disco on your playlist. Do you guys listen to a lot of disco?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, that music gets you on the floor. It was disco at the Bronx Zoo,” Miller says. The hora combined the two families’ traditions in a special way. The hip-hop dancing that Miller’s family does even has ties to Israeli folk dance. “The hora is this very traditional Jewish dance, and yet it was so beautiful to see all of our loved ones getting down to it,” Pfeiffer says. The zoo’s preferred bakery is Conti’s Pastry Shoppe in the Bronx, which happened to be right near Miller’s childhood neighborhood. “It was just so funny, like, oh my God, all these things keep coming together,” he says.  The couple was split over whether to have carrot cake or red velvet cake. “We were like, okay, let’s just flip a coin over it. Then at one point, I was talking with our planner about it, and she was like, well, why don’t you just ask if they can do both? And I was like, oh, that’s a really good point,” Pfeiffer recalls. Spoiler alert: They were able to have both. “It was almost a lesson that sometimes you don’t have to pick one thing over the other—you can have both. I just love that.” Adrienne Gaffney is a features editor at ELLE and previously worked at WSJ Magazine and Vanity Fair.

              " 'Maeve Reilly and Zach Quittman married at the cult-favorite hotel Palm Heights. Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. When Maeve Reilly envisioned her wedding day with Zach Quittman, the first thing she saw was Palm Heights, the Grand Cayman hotel she’d visited with friends. “I thought, I have to get married here,” she says. “We really wanted a destination wedding—all of our favorite people in one place, experiencing an amazing weekend away.”  The couple worked with planner Mindy Weiss and her team, including colleague Andrew Haupt, to put everything together. Maeve, a stylist, worked on Hailey Bieber’s wedding, where she first met Weiss. “I had put together a Pinterest board of inspiration and vibes that I liked. When Zach and I went to do our site visit, it was literally just so seamless,” she says. “Our guests made up a majority of the hotel, so that tied into the whole intimacy vibes of everyone being together at all times,” says Zach, who is a real estate agent. “Wherever you went, whether it was the gym or the couple of restaurants, you ran into your people. That was a huge thing of just being together all weekend.”   The hotel is relatively small and massively popular, so booking it isn’t easy. “They’re kind of particular about who does weddings there. I think they just know that it could be a wedding venue every weekend, because it’s so special and they actually don’t want to do that,” Maeve says. “I reached out to Gab [owner Gabriella Khalil] and, thankfully, she was so excited about it and said yes.” There is only one direct flight a day between Los Angeles, where Maeve and Zach live, and the Cayman Islands, which meant that nearly everyone on the plane was heading to the wedding. Unfortunately, the group experienced a delay, which meant that they had to rush to get ready for a family cocktail party they had planned. “The first night was sort of a blur. We hadn’t eaten, we were just trying to see everybody, and we finally sat down to eat dinner and it just kind of all hit us what was about to happen,” she says. Maeve wore a stretchy sheath dress that was part of a bridal capsule from SSENSE. “It was very scary weather leading up to the wedding, which was such a curve ball. I’ve been following the hotel [on Instagram] since I had been there last. They post Stories every day, and I have never seen anything but a blue sky. I have never seen rain. I have never seen a cloud,” Maeve says. “All of a sudden, right before the wedding, there is terrible weather and it’s raining every day. As we landed, the rain cleared. I couldn’t believe it.” Palm Heights hosts a regular Saturday pizza party/karaoke/dance night called Mambo Italiano. Maeve and Zach convinced them to move it to Friday night to serve as their welcome party. “It’s like an outdoor Italian pizzeria with little umbrellas, and then the bar turns into the karaoke booth, basically,” says Zach.  Maeve’s mother and sisters sang “Going to the Chapel,” and her friend Jennifer Meyer gave a toast. “We had the best night. Everyone was like, ‘How are you going to top this? After the first night?’ Some people said that it was the most fun party they’d ever been to in their life,” Maeve says. Maeve was excited to wear a Wiederhoeft dress. It had the line’s distinct and beautiful corset look, and while it wasn’t ready until 10 days before the wedding, Maeve was confident the look would work out. Zach is a big fan of Aimé Leon Dore and wore a head-to-toe look from the boutique. Later in the evening, Maeve changed into a silk Vivienne Westwood dress from a 2015 collection. Maeve always knew that she’d wear a Vivienne Westwood gown. “I’m such a Vivienne girl. I love a corset and I love that silhouette and I just know what’s best on my body type,” she says. “I just knew I would end up there. I just didn’t know which dress, and I was looking for the drama and that skirt.” She loved the classic look of the dress and wanted to keep her accessories minimal. Later in the evening, Maeve changed into an archival Vivienne Westwood style adorned with sequins that she believes had only ever been worn by model Erin Wasson. For his part, Zach wore a full Dolce & Gabbana suit. Maeve and Zach were married by Dr. Habib Sadeghi, their spiritual advisor. “It was definitely the highlight of my life,” Maeve explains. “It was really deep and profound, and just unlike any ceremony I’ve ever seen. I felt really in the moment and really present.” She walked down the aisle to the piano version of “Goodspeed” by Frank Ocean, her favorite song. “It was a picture-perfect day. Sunshine, aqua-blue water, and the first sunset in two weeks,” Zach says. Everyone was thrilled by the food at the reception. “The best bread roll you’ve ever had in your life,” Zach said about the hotel’s signature coconut roll. “All of our guests came up to us saying, ‘That’s the best wedding food we’ve ever had.’” The menu also included a cucumber salad with yogurt, ceviche, vegan curry with naan. The after-party was held at a Bar Bambi, a club within the hotel. “My little brother’s a DJ, so he controlled the music. He literally crushed it and set the vibe so high,” Zach says. “We went until 3 A.M. and then ended up in the pool.” Adrienne Gaffney is a features editor at ELLE and previously worked at WSJ Magazine and Vanity Fair.

              " 'An upcoming Hulu documentary pulls back the curtain on the designer’s life and career.  Style Points is a weekly column about how fashion intersects with the wider world. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy made her name as a documentarian by being unafraid to tackle challenging topics, from honor killings in Pakistan to the rise of the Taliban. So you might not expect her latest subject to be Diane von Furstenberg, the designer best known for her flirty, trend-proof wrap dress and glamorous lifestyle.  But for Obaid-Chinoy, Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge, which she co-directed with Trish Dalton and which premieres tomorrow on Hulu, wasn’t as much of a pivot as you might think. Von Furstenberg’s story, she says, “is very much in the same vein as so many of the others that I’ve done. It’s about a woman who’s faced with extraordinary circumstances and how she rises to the occasion.” Obaid-Chinoy and her subject have been friendly for a decade, after von Furstenberg presented her with an award for her 2012 film Saving Face, about acid attacks on women in Pakistan. They had even talked about ideas for a documentary on one of her DVF Awards recipients. “But I went back to her and  said, ‘Diane, people really just want to hear your story.’ And she said, ‘Oh, I don’t want to tell my story.’” A few years later, however, the designer decided she was on board. And so was a chorus of talking heads, from Oprah Winfrey to Hillary Clinton to Marc Jacobs, who weigh in throughout the film. (“Let’s just say that there was nobody that we asked who said no,” Obaid-Chinoy laughs.)  The documentary unearths details of DVF’s life story that the public might not know as well as her runway designs and boldfaced appearances in the society pages. Von Furstenberg’s mother was a Holocaust survivor who, after being released from Auschwitz weighing only 44 pounds, was told by her doctor that she could never have children. Eighteen months later, von Furstenberg came into the world, her very existence an act of defiance.  “Just the fact that I was born,” she says in the documentary, “was a victory.”  “We showed this film in a small private screening the other day,” says Obaid-Chinoy, “and someone said to us, ‘Is there something that hasn’t happened to Diane?’ She has led a life of so many ups and downs and twists and turns. So much has been thrown at her,” from her bout with cancer and her ex-husband Egon von Furstenberg’s battle with HIV to her daughter’s struggle with a neuromuscular disease and her mother’s mental-health challenges. You get the sense that, in contrast to so many overly focus-grouped designers, nothing is off the table.  “I don’t think that people realize how she was born out of the ashes of World War II. How she was an immigrant to America,” adds Obaid-Chinoy. “Even though she had married a prince, she came to America with a suitcase full of dresses and ideas about how she wanted to be an independent person.” Von Furstenberg’s story is an idiosyncratic one, but its contours feel universal. “If you chart the arc of her life, you can literally see the gains that women have made,” Obaid-Chinoy says. In the film, Fran Lebowitz points out that women in fashion were typically models, not designers, back then, and that it was still unusual for a woman to be the head of a fashion business. When she started DVF, a woman still needed a man’s co-signature to sign up for a credit card. “Her story is emblematic of a woman opening doors for other women,” says Obaid-Chinoy. “Gloria Steinem says in the film that Diane changed the nature of the room that she was in. She wasn’t trying to fit in and play the game the way it was being played. She changed that completely.” In the mid-1970s, von Furstenberg went on a mall tour to, yes, promote her fashion line, but also to talk to women about feminism and the importance of not depending on men.  Later, as women poured into the workforce, she remained someone they could look to as a beacon. Post-divorce, she was a single mother navigating the world of business and the sexism that came with it. And then when her fashion brand hit turbulence, she reinvented herself as a QVC goddess, making her one of the first Establishment designers to align herself with the network.  One of the most affecting parts of the documentary is the opening scene, which underscores von Furstenberg’s refreshing take on aging. She’s curled up in her sink, face against the mirror, proudly examining her skin. “I’ve always been attracted [to] wrinkles,” she says. “You shouldn’t say how old you are, you should say how long you have lived.”  “For me personally, it was liberating,” says Obaid-Chinoy. “I choose not to dye my hair. I fully embrace the fact that I’m a woman in my forties. And she reinforced for me: Why do you have to place these unrealistic expectations on yourself about your age? Trish and I, when we were working on the film, were like, This is an incredible way of looking at yourself. This is a message that women and girls need to hear.” Adds Dalton, “But also, she’s obviously very sexy. She’s seductive. You look at the movie and, like, she’s gorgeous. So that is part of it too.”  Next up, Obaid-Chinoy will become the first female director to helm a Star Wars movie with New Jedi Order. But it’s hard to imagine a narrative more thrillingly out-of-this-world than this one: a woman proudly aging, and loving every minute of it.

              " 'The Comme Si designer set out to reinvent the humble sock—and created a blossoming lifestyle brand in the process.  Style Points is a weekly column about how fashion intersects with the wider world. “A lot of stylists that I know keep trunks” full of socks, says designer Jenni Lee. “They hoard them because they don’t know when they’re going to come across another really good one.” And when they do, they obsess over every detail, from ribbing to weight. “My theory,” she hazards, “is that they see so many clothes, they appreciate the simple little luxuries more.” It doesn’t hurt that a sock remains the ultimate runway styling hack, whether used to perfect coquettecore effect at Sandy Liang or paired with a preppy loafer at Gucci’s recent cruise show in London.  Lee shares the obsession, so much so that she assembled her own hoard. Having not been able to find styles she liked stateside, she began collecting them on trips to Korea. “When people think of socks, especially in the U.S., you imagine kitschy socks with cats printed on them,” she says. As she collected higher-quality styles, she developed more and more opinions. Which led to the question so many designers arrive at: What if I designed the [fill in the blank] I want to wear?  After emailing Italian factories and not receiving a response, she decided to drop in while on vacation there. “I plugged them in on a map, my husband and I rented a car, and we stopped by each one. I was like, ‘I’m just going to show up. If somebody wants to talk to me, great.’” Two of those factory owners are her partners now, but initially, she was met with skepticism and told that women wouldn’t spend money on a high-end sock. People also told her that the category was volatile, because trends are apt to change much more quickly in the women’s space. But, she says, “I had a conviction that there were other women like me who wanted what I was about to create.” Socks are an item that seem deceptively simple but are hard to get right—especially when you’re a perfectionist to the degree that Lee is. Hers went through multiple rounds of beta testing. “Because it’s a small item, you’d think it would be easy, but it’s actually harder because it is so small,” she says. “A change in the weight of the yarn makes it feel like a slightly different style of a sock. I spent a lot of time on material, because hand-feel is super important. And then, obviously, foot-feel.” At $60 for a ribbed silk style and $90 for cashmere, that exquisite foot-feel comes at a high cost, but Lee defends the price point. “If I wanted to sell cheaper socks, I would have to make them more cheaply and not in Italy. I understand the hesitance there, but I do think that people appreciate what they’re paying for and understand it. “The beautiful thing about fashion,” she adds, “is that it’s an emotional business. There’s no logic for why people should spend this amount of money on the things that they do, but there’s a lot of art and consideration that goes into how people dress, and how it makes them feel, how it makes others feel, how it inspires them.” If the idea of the lipstick index, in which customers start to substitute small luxuries for bigger ones, returns to fashion, a bright sock might also elicit the same dopamine hit as a bright tube. “Little luxury and everyday luxury are phrases we use often,” Lee says. “A lot of people are used to wearing their exercise tube sock and throwing on a nice shoe with it. And what we are offering is: ‘No, your nice shoe deserves a nice sock.’” Lee has expanded her empire beyond socks, but she’s done it cautiously. She started with loungewear, including her smash-hit cotton poplin boxers, which are meant to be a street style statement. Her collaborations, too, have been few and well-thought-out. She teamed up with Liberty on pieces in their signature cheerful floral fabrics, a partnership that she says will be ongoing. She also recently linked up with the Swiss brand USM Modular Furniture. “It is a little strange, a sock brand and a furniture brand,” she admits. “But what made it make sense is, our customer is buying their furniture. This person is curating their life with intention, and it goes from their home all the way down to the socks that they wear.”  For the holidays, she opened a haven-like pop-up in Brooklyn, something that had been a dream of hers since the beginning. “I love the idea of having a brand that people want to experience in real life,” she says, adding that she modeled her outpost after calzaturas, sock-specific shops in Italy, including Gammarelli, the famed Roman spot that outfits the Pope.  But the way she really knows she’s succeeded: things have come full circle and Comme Si is stylist-approved; her wares have been added to countless trunks and kits. (“They photograph really well. You can tell when something looks cheap,” she notes.) Ayo Edebiri and Emma Stone are among those who’ve recently worn Lee’s designs. Stylists “get really excited to introduce it to their clients, because I think they understand that they’re sitting on set all day and would appreciate this little luxury.” There used to be a different tinge to the holiday refrain of, “Oh great, I got socks again,” but now, they have cachet. I have a friend,” jokes Lee, “who said, ‘You know you’re 30 when being gifted really nice socks is actually a treat—not an eye roll.’” DVF Is the Subject Of a New Hulu Documentary The Data Scientist Cracking Fashion’s Codes What Does Preppy Style Mean Now?

              " 'Madé Lapuerta, the creator of Data, But Make It Fashion, is crunching the numbers on Sambas and tenniscore.  Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. Style Points is a weekly column about how fashion intersects with the wider world. If you read much current trend reporting, you might think that skinny jeans are verboten or that Sambas have finally reached their saturation point. Madé Lapuerta doesn’t necessarily see it that way. The creator of the Instagram account @databutmakeitfashion has become somewhat of a counterintuitive force in the industry, dispensing data-driven analyses of trends and trendlets to her nearly 300,000 followers. Like a stock ticker, her account keeps track of the faintest fluctuations: tenniscore is up, coquette style is down. She’s become a bullshit detector in an age of ever more confusing and esoteric TikTok-bred trends.  Lapuerta got her start the way so many women in media did: through boy band fan culture. “I don’t know if you remember the era of One Direction,” she says, instantly making me feel ancient. Back then, she was in eighth grade and deep in 1D Tumblr. Wanting to put one of their songs on her blog, she started learning to code. At the time, she says, “I didn’t know anything about fashion, and you could tell by how I dressed.” But later, as a junior at Harvard, she watched the documentary McQueen and had an awakening. “I thought fashion was just a lot of logos, and there’s some truth to that, but it’s obviously so much more,” she says now. “I instantly fell in love. I thought I would be a computer science person, and then on the side, I would have an interest in fashion.” She didn’t realize she could combine her passions until that summer, when she was interning at Google.  When she would read about what was deemed in or out, “I was like, ‘Wait, okay, hold up, though. How do I actually know? Is this just one influencer’s opinion, or is this actually in style?’” she says. “Coming from a numbers and engineering background, it was very important for me to verify it. And a lot of times I find that it’s not verified. It’s not actually in.” Lapuerta sees herself as distinct from trend forecasters, who are more like soothsayers, looking ahead to future seasons. “I see myself as a data scientist who really likes fashion,” she says. “I don’t do as many predictions. I try and stay very current and real-time.” She engages in “social listening,” combing articles and posts about a specific trend or brand, then running a sentiment analysis, “which is a data analytics method of quantifying how positive language is,” she explains. “I’ll also look at tweets because there’s a lot of fashion discourse that happens on X [formerly known as Twitter].” She scrutinizes likes, finding, for example, that Zendaya receives a higher number on her posts than other celebrities. And at the reaction to seismic moments at the celebrity-fashion nexus, whether it’s Peso Pluma wearing Prada at Coachella or Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal in Gucci at the Golden Globes. All of that, she says, “can help me quantify how trends are changing or what’s popular in fashion and put a number behind it.” Like, say, 75: the percent increase in interest in Stella McCartney that Lapuerta clocked after Taylor Swift wore the designer’s bag at Coachella. Even negative feedback can sometimes indicate interest: often, when Lapuerta posts that something is going up in popularity, she’ll get comments from people who hate that thing. “That’s okay, but it’s coming from somewhere,” she says. “If you don’t like the trend, anytime that you talk about it, it raises its popularity, or it encourages more discussion and then people look at it more. I think it’s interesting when people hate on trends so publicly, and then you take a look and realize people secretly like them. A lot of negative press eventually turns into attention, and eventually that trend increases in positivity.” The process isn’t an exact science, and it comes with some limitations, as she’s the first to admit. If she sees tweets about a new Miley Cyrus look that “use language like, ‘This outfit is sick,’ or ‘I’m dead,’ the sentiment analysis might pick that up as very negative, whereas you and I both know they’re hyping up the outfit,” she says. “That’s something that definitely requires manual intervention.” She also notes that when she’s perusing fashion X, she may be looking at a sampling of individuals who are more engaged and in tune with industry news, compared to the average person. When some on the platform were touting the return of the McQueen bumster silhouette, she found a lot of conversation about it among high-fashion-oriented social media users. But her research suggested the revival had yet to hit the mainstream, “even though a lot of people within the runway sphere were talking about it.” Amid the cacophony of endless TikTok trends, Lapuerta believes that data can be a tool for making sense of the madness. For example, the mob wife trend, which, according to her research, peaked around the beginning of the year, then took a steep dive. “It’s interesting to try and take an objective look at the life cycle of a trend, because now you see that it’s months, or sometimes a couple of weeks.” Whereas something like ballet flats, which have hung on for two years, “are not so much a social media fad. This is something that people just like.” While some fashion commentators have abandoned the idea of the hemline index, or fashion trend-as-economic-indicator, Lapuerta describes herself as “a big believer” in the concept. “One that I posted about that I stand by was the rise of the office siren,” which she sees as “an interesting way to get people really excited about going back into the office. I know it made me excited to get dressed up and go to work.” Since starting her account, Lapuerta has released four trend books summarizing her findings. And she’s been experimenting with new formats, like style icon starter packs and “what’s in my bag” features (and even a guide to dressing like your favorite programming language.) But the most important function of her account, she says, is as “a tool to let people who are underrepresented in technology or STEM fields understand that what makes you different can be what makes you successful. I struggled so much in college, and in my first internships, feeling like I didn’t fit in in tech. Even if you don’t like fashion, even if you might not love the trends that I post about, I hope this shows younger people or women or anyone who’s underrepresented in tech that this is still a space for us. Even if you strongly deviate from what the tech-bro stereotype looks like.” DVF Is the Subject Of a New Hulu Documentary Jenni Lee Is Changing Fashion From the Ankle Up What Does Preppy Style Mean Now?

              " 'The OG prep chronicler, Lisa Birnbach, helps us break down 2024’s take on the aesthetic.  Style Points is a weekly column about how fashion intersects with the wider world. Lisa Birnbach has seen this all before. The author of The Official Preppy Handbook, which went old-world viral in 1980, is peering out from her proverbial Lacoste visor at yet another preppy revival. Whether it’s Emma Chamberlain going full dark academia at Paris Fashion Week, Zendaya mixing tenniscore and 2000s prep in the upcoming Luca Guadagnino  film Challengers, or boat shoes, of all things, popping up at Miu Miu, there’s no doubt that the aesthetic has made its umpteenth comeback.   But what does preppy style signify now? And how did an aesthetic that once felt niche and exclusionary take over the world?  First of all, “it’s much more exciting than it was in 1980,” Birnbach says of today’s preppy universe. “The audience keeps getting more fashionable, and younger.” And the style is far more legible, as well. When she first published the book, she says, “I had to begin every single interview, whether it was print or TV or radio, with ‘Lisa, what is a preppy?’” as though she were explicating a new species to a zoology class.  Prep 1.0 “was private, it was quiet, and those were different times. Without the digital space, there was no oversharing. Privacy was understood, and it was a currency.” Now, “I have kids who are in their 20s and 30s, and they would no sooner not share an experience. You do something, you share it, you put it online. So imagine not having that ability and also valuing discretion, which is what the preppy community was like.” It was also hard to access. In the early ’80s, if you were wearing these clothes, you either ordered them through the mail, or you physically went somewhere and brought them back, whether it was Bermuda or Darien, Connecticut. The fit, too, was less precise. The garments “were baggy and rumpled, and they were not meant to look trendy.” By the time Birnbach’s 2010 follow-up True Prep rolled around, “there were so many new brands, I felt like a godmother in a way. Everything fit well, everything was in bright colors instead of the four: camel, red, navy, gray, and white.” By then, major designers like Tory Burch and Thom Browne were putting their own spin on the aesthetic, one that had wide-ranging ripple effects. (Thanks to Browne’s influence, Birnbach says, “I haven’t seen a picture of a groom at a wedding wearing socks in five years.”)  Now, the style has become a global lingua franca, “a default way of dressing for people all over the world.” When Birnbach embarked on an international tour for True Prep, she found preppies of all stripes, from Japan to France. This season, that global aspect was particularly evident, as the style was filtered through Miuccia Prada’s Italian tailoring lens, Dries Van Noten’s eccentric Belgian eye, and Maison Kitsuné’s Japanese-French sensibility. One aspect of the current prep movement, with its high-end takes on polo shirts and boat shoes, feels at odds with the original ethos. “Preppies are frugal,” Birnbach points out. “We’re getting used to a plate of spaghetti costing $35 in a restaurant. Spaghetti and tomato sauce! That’s extortion. A $1,000 white cotton shirt is also, in my opinion, the other side of preppy. It’s just too much.” Price tags aside, people tend to opt for safety in times of uncertainty. And for anything that confers status, à la the quiet luxury and stealth wealth trends, Birnbach calls preppy fashion “comfort food.” She mentions the emotional toll of the pandemic, and adds, “I think we’re still at the beginning of that. We’re not sure it’s over. And to be honest, things are emotionally worse right now as we’re on a wobble board waiting to see if our democracy will survive the election. I’m speaking of Americans, but the whole world is in flux. And I do think throwing on a cardigan or the oldest pair of corduroys that you own,” is the sartorial equivalent of putting down an anchor. “It’s about finding something solid and familiar.” For many who are now hopping onboard the trend, she believes, it’s “not about fashion. It’s just about wearing something that endures. And for others, it’s this minute, right now, and then they’ll wear [the clothes], take good care of them and sell them on The RealReal in eight months.” Regardless of which camp you’re in, rituals and rules (yes, even in the form of office clothing) are feeling more sacred. Frustrated by vague directions to “find your personal style,” people are now looking to be told how to dress, crave style guidelines, and are nostalgic for the traditional uniforms of another time. “I heard myself say to somebody the other day, ‘I want to get dressed. I want to put on a dress and heels and go to dinner.’ Now, that rarely happens,” Birnbach says. “No matter how much you pay for a plate of spaghetti.” DVF Is the Subject Of a New Hulu Documentary Jenni Lee Is Changing Fashion From the Ankle Up The Data Scientist Cracking Fashion’s Codes Johnny Cirillo Is Always Watching New York Roberto Cavalli’s Designs Radiated Sex  Dries van Noten Is Waving Goodbye To the Runway Too Much Was Never Enough for Iris Apfel Monica Lewinsky Is a Fashion Campaign Star at 50 Zac Posen on Dressing Capote’s Swans The Rise of the Mended Haul  Will the Mob Wife Aesthetic End Quiet Luxury?

In ELLE.com’s monthly series Office Hours, we ask people in powerful positions to take us through their first jobs, worst jobs, and everything in between. This month, we spoke to Veronica Miele Beard and Veronica Swanson Beard, the sisters-in-law behind the nearly eponymous women’s brand, Veronica Beard. With respective backgrounds in finance and fashion, the two founders (who are married to brothers) chose to channel their mutual love for clothing and entrepreneurship into a business of their own. “We set out to create a uniform for a woman the way a man had a suit and tie,” Miele Beard says. In 2010, they launched with their dickey jacket, the brand’s now-signature item, and since then, they’ve expanded into a number of other categories, including handbags this February. But even as the company has exploded, their bond has stayed close. “We’re family—so we’re really united in this,” Swanson Beard says. “It’s not like you can have a fight and break up. We’re married to each other, and we’re married to this business.” Below, their secrets for making their partnership work. VSB: My first job was in high school, coaching tennis at a camp. I grew up playing tennis; I still play it twice a week. I loved this summer camp, because all my friends did it too, all these cute guys I knew were there, the kids were awesome. If you do something that you love, it never feels like work, and for me, that job was really the beginning of understanding that.  VMB: I’ve worked since I was 12 at little jobs, but my first notable job was at [the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette] DLJ. I really wanted to go to Wall Street when I graduated from college, but it was ridiculously hard to get a job. I got my job at DLJ out of the newspaper, because back then we did not have LinkedIn. We didn’t even have phones, really. I walked in there, and it was daunting. It was all men, and it was strictly professional. I was scared and excited, and I was able to move out of my house and get an apartment and really be on my own. VSB: My first fashion job was interning at Oscar de la Renta, which was amazing. I loved it, but the receptionist at the showroom was out, so they put me at the front desk to answer the phones, and I could not figure out how to work the phones and hung up on Mr. de la Renta like four times. I think anything having to do with computers or telephones is not my wheelhouse. VMB: At DLJ, there were men that worked next to me, and we were doing the same job, but they were able to advance, and I was supposed to stay as a sales assistant, because I was a girl. I went to the head of the floor, and I said, “Why am I not able to have this opportunity and these guys do?” And they said to me, “Women need MBAs here.” I was so broken and horrified. I resigned that week. VSB: We met long, long, long before we became business partners. We became friends, and then sisters-in-law. I had a fashion background, Veronica had a finance background, but we had a mutual love of fashion, of product, of supply and demand, entrepreneurialism, ideas, and would talk about all of these things at every family or social gathering. There were a lot of bad ideas before the good idea. But it was always about what women really wanted and what was missing in the market. The dickey jacket existed in menswear for a long time, in terms of zip-out inserts in jackets, but it didn’t exist in women’s wear. Great brands always have their one starting item, and that was our signature piece. It still is. VMB: We used to call it the Wonder Woman cape, because you put it on, and you slayed dragons. You felt confident. It’s something that informs everything we create: Does it have that “wow” factor?  VMB: We’re both control freaks, and we’re very similar in certain ways and also very different. But we know our pressure points, and we know what’s important to us. So it’s like, I’m not going to die on that mountain; she lets me be me, and I let her be her. That’s most important. You also have to see the big picture; I always try to feel like it’s all going to play out. But that’s a maturity thing too. VSB: What has never changed is that we share an office. We have always had an office with two desks in it. It’s something we don’t even think about, because it’s almost like siblings who share a bedroom. VMB: There are a lot of big-picture items that we have to discuss, and then there’s like, “What do we say to the press? What do we say here?” VSB: It’s like pillow talk with your husband. VMB: We get over shit really fast. There are no grudges here. We’ve had fights, and we’re like, “That’s awful. You offended me.” And then it’s like, “Anyway, what are we doing now?” VSB: That’s sisterhood. You can totally have a blowout fight, and then you’re hanging out. VSB: The reality is when you have a family business, it’s everything all the time. If I’m late for something—I’ve got a kid’s doctor’s appointment—I’m calling her, she’s covering the meeting. She’s got to go to a basketball tournament, I’m staying. So much of what we’re able to do is because there are two of us, and we have the same name. It doesn’t matter if I go to that event or she goes to that event—one of us showed up. VSB: I think decisiveness and compartmentalism are my superpowers. That’s fully from being a mother—knowing what I will do, what I won’t do, what I have time for, what I don’t. Having kids made us focus on our priorities. When we started this business, it was like, we have to be a good mom, get home, take care of our kids, have this business. It wasn’t like we could go to every opening of an envelope, every fashion party. There just wasn’t time for that, so it kept us very disciplined. VMB: Giselle [Bündchen]. VSB: Gwyneth Paltrow for me, because it was right when she started Goop, and I was a fan. In that moment, she was that mom, on-the-go entrepreneur; she was everything. She was the multi-hyphenate dream person for us. She wore our jacket with a striped dickey and these baggy jeans, and she just looked so effortless and cool. VMB: JLo showed up with it, Sarah Jessica Parker wore it. This was so early that we couldn’t have gotten to them; we were like, “Oh my God, they actually bought it.” This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

In ELLE.com’s series Office Hours, we ask people in powerful positions to take us through their first jobs, worst jobs, and everything in between. Below, we spoke with Julianne Goldmark, who founded hair accessories brand Emi Jay as a teenager in 2009. Over a decade and a total brand re-launch later, Goldmark introduced Angelstick, Emi Jay’s first hair styling product, last year. “Making that decision to start formulating and creating a product like Angelstick was a huge risk, because you don’t know if a company that’s been known just for accessories is going to be necessarily taken seriously when it comes to hair care and hair styling products,” she says. The risk paid off: Emi Jay’s community quickly fell in love with Angelstick. In anticipation of Emi Jay’s first hair care product Dream Crème, which launched this week, Goldmark tells us all about the evolution of her company, what it’s like working with her mom, and how her Korean heritage continues to inspire her. My first job was a camp counselor at a day camp. I had to wrangle kids and make snow cones and play games all day. I loved it because it was in the summer, and I did it with some friends growing up. I did it multiple summers in a row, and I always looked forward to it.  I tried to start a dog washing business. I made fliers for it and everything. I thought it was going to be easy. but neighborhood friends and family friends ended up bringing their big dogs. So I had to figure out a way to wash multiple large dogs a day. As you can imagine, it was not very cute. It was messy and wet. I want to say I was 12, so I was old enough to know that this probably wasn’t going to be my best skill, but I still tried it. I started Emi Jay when I was pretty young—I was 14. We’ve been in business for 14 years now. But we have gone through a lot of evolution and change. When I left college, I wanted to figure out if Emi Jay was truly my passion and if accessories and hair was where I wanted to be. So I took on another job working for an interior designer, and then I did some freelance marketing work for a couple of brands. Self esteem. Self-expression. I always say that you could be wearing head-to-toe sweats, and you can make such a statement with your hair. Whether it’s a slicked-back bun with a clip or little pieces in the front or a ponytail or even just flat iron waves, there are so many ways to express yourself through your hair. And obviously there’s very out-there ways to express yourself through your hair, whether it’s dyeing, color, or more intricate accessories. Growing up, I had very thick hair in comparison to my friends. All my friends would use the skinny little cute hair ties, and I used the big ones, and they would snap all the time. I remember being sick of it. So it was nice that, years later when we made our hair ties, it was not possible to snap them. Initially, we started making hair ties, and it started as a passion project. I would sit on my bedroom floor after homework, and I’d dye underwear elastic, and then I’d add gemstones to it and go to the fabric store and get all these different pieces of tulle and rhinestones and hot glue a bunch of stuff together. I started to give them to my friends at school and sell them just as a fun little thing. Then, it turned into making a website and turned into more of an organic small business. At the time, Instagram didn’t exist.  In 2019, we decided to rebrand and shift away from what we had known for so long, which was just hair ties and headbands, like super basic everyday hair ties that didn’t dent your hair. It was an elevated alternative to a drugstore hair tie. That’s when we came up with the idea to bring back the claw clip in different sizes and variations and some beautiful shades. They did amazingly, so we decided to make the shift into claw clips, and then it transitioned into brushes, and now hair care. It’s definitely been a journey. I always say that there’s Emi Jay 1.0 and Emi Jay 2.0. Because to me, I feel like we’ve only been doing this for maybe four or five years because of how much we intentionally rebranded and restructured.   Working with any family member has its ups and downs. Of course, I think that especially growing up as a teenager, and throughout my 20s, spending pretty much every single day with my mom has been such a blessing and such a unique experience. It’s been interesting, and I would say at times hard, to navigate a mother-daughter relationship. But at the same time, [I know] that we both want what’s best for one another and what’s best for the company. And we both have so many of the same ideas and creativity and attention to detail that it all works. It all makes sense. It’s like a really special and unique bond that we’ll always have. From brushes to clips to scrunchies and Angelstick, we want things to be simple and easy. When I’m getting ready in the morning, I like to get ready in 10 minutes. I know a lot of our customers are either moms or working moms, they’re on the go, they’re in school or in college, they’re traveling, there’s a lot of things happening at once, and we always say that our products are made for girls with places to be.  I love a hair treatment that I can either do really quickly and wash out or keep in my hair all day. I love Dream Crème and the formula because you can leave it in for five to 10 minutes and wash it out, and your hair’s revived and refreshed. But then you can also keep it in and clip it up with one of our clips all day long and wash out at the end of the day. So it’s super on-the-go friendly. It ties back to effective products that can be integrated into your everyday routine. Ever since I was younger, my grandma was very into hair. She would always teach me to brush your hair 100 times every night. So I always gravitated towards hair, accessories, hair products—anything for the hair. And I grew up going to the Korean markets, and they always had the cutest accessories and the cutest brushes. I remember the tiny little brushes that had sparkles, little flowers, and doodads. As a kid, I was annoyed that my grandma would drag me to the Korean market. I was always like, “I don’t want to do that. I want to go to the normal market.” I didn’t have that proudness that I have now. But I would get there, and I would be enamored with the brushes and the little clips and accessories and little combs and stuff they would sell there. That excited feeling, fawning over these products, is a huge part of what I want our customers to feel when they get their Emi Jay package in the mail. In Korean culture, hair health is a huge thing. Scalp health is a huge thing. As we veer into hair care and hair styling products, I definitely keep that in mind.  I would love to reach a wider demographic, age-wise. I feel like a lot of times, people maybe associate the brand with being young or aimed toward the center of a certain generation. But what I’ve learned a lot through our research is that it’s actually a lot of moms and daughters that are buying our products. Creating and emphasizing that our market is for everyone is something I want to focus on. Harry Styles. The girls in our office were like, “We need to get our clips to Harry Styles.” So we sent some over to his team. You never know if they’re actually going to get it or what’s going to happen, but then he wore one of our Super Bloom Clips like a week after we sent it.

In ELLE.com’s monthly series Office Hours, we ask people in powerful positions to take us through their first jobs, worst jobs, and everything in between. This month, we spoke to Erika Ayers Badan, CEO of recipe and cookwear website Food52 and the author of Nobody Cares About Your Career: Why Failure is Good, The Great Ones Play Hurt and Other Hard Truths, out this week. Prior to her current role, Ayers Badan spent nine years as the CEO of Barstool Sports, where she took the sports media company from a Boston-based brand to a national powerhouse and podcasting juggernaut. “I just took a new job and I’m launching a book—it’s kind of stupid to do both in one month,”  she says with a laugh. “I’m just trying to keep my head above water now, I would say. But I’m looking forward to Food52. I really believe in female founders and a female customer, and I’m excited to have the opportunity to learn both and to evolve and to grow this company into something it hasn’t been yet.” Here, Ayers Badan talks about working in an all-male environment, getting a job you thought you had no chance at, and writing a book on her phone. I had an internship at Fidelity, where I was a receptionist, and I cut my hair very short. At the time, I was sharing Ann Taylor separates with all my roommates in Boston. I was very bored, spending all day sitting and watching these two glass doors on the 12th floor of 86 Devonshire Street. I started to ask the secretaries what other work I could do. I was very industrious that summer, trying to pick up whatever odd job I could, just not to be bored, sitting, staring at the door. I was a water slide attendant at Weirs Beach in New Hampshire, and [I was] terrible at it. I just never really timed it; I let the people go down the slide and they would always run into each other.  When Dave Portnoy created Barstool Sports, my girlfriends and I would read the paper on the train because we were bored and we didn’t have any money and it was free. I was really familiar with the brand, and I had left a CMO position at AOL to launch a startup in the music space, which was really about building community and connection between artists and their fans. I had modeled a lot of it on Barstool. One day, I found myself in Los Angeles in a meeting with The Chernin Group, and they said, “We just invested in this company you’ve never heard of. It’s Barstool Sports.”  I was like, “Oh, I’ve heard of it,” and then proceeded to hijack the meeting to only talk about Barstool. I left very jealous, because I thought that they would find a white guy with an MBA who worked in sports and had a blue button-down shirt to take the CEO job. I stalked my network to get an introduction to Barstool and see if I could have a chance at having that job. I was the 75th candidate and the only woman, and I ended up getting it.  There had only ever been one woman [who worked] there before [me]. One thing I loved about Barstool is, even though when I got there I was the only woman, there was no infrastructure. They didn’t have a P&L, they didn’t have a company email, they didn’t have meetings, they didn’t know what Slack was. They’d never used PowerPoint. What they had was a lot of personality and a lot of character, a lot of passion and a lot of conviction about what they were doing. What was really nice about Barstool is that while it wasn’t the most professional place when I got there, everything was so open and everything was so honest. Working at big companies, whether it was Microsoft or Yahoo! or the ad agencies, there was a lot of sexism and there was a lot of sexual harassment, but it was always insidious. Barstool was so refreshing because they didn’t care if you were a man, a woman, or an animal. It was the most open place and the most accepting place I’ve ever worked, which is not, I think, what people would expect when they think about Barstool Sports. I was talking to someone the other day and they were like, “What’s the biggest difference?” I responded, “The bathrooms are so clean.” The bathrooms are much, much, much cleaner, the office is far more beautiful, and I wear a skirt every day. But Barstool taught me a lot. It taught me a lot about resilience. It taught me a lot about people. It taught me a lot about the internet. It taught me a lot about culture and content. It prepared me well. Food52 is a completely different world. It has a completely different customer. It talks about different things. It does different things. So, I’m really in the learning phase. I think most people expected that I would stay in sports and work in sports betting or do something very similar to Barstool. And I made the move to Food52 as I was writing the end of the book, which [questioned]: do I stay or do I go? It’s fairly uncommon to be at the stage of my career and make such a left turn. That’s what I’m so excited about. It was always about the people, and always about the moments where we made something happen that no one thought could happen. The first time we got Barstool on television was an incredible feat, and I couldn’t believe it.  I wrote this book predominantly on my phone, on the train. My phone is my preferred place to write. I wrote it at a time where we had just sold Barstool. I had this wild, free, creative, never-know-what’s-going-to-happen job for seven years. All of a sudden, I was buried in spreadsheets and had a boss and had to go meet with people who weren’t at Barstool. My creativity was zapped, and it made me want to get all of that emotion out somehow.   This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " 'Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. In ELLE.com’s monthly series Office Hours, we ask people in powerful positions to take us through their first jobs, worst jobs, and everything in between. This month, we spoke to ELLE alum Laney Crowell, who founded the beauty brand Saie in 2019, after leaving a nearly five-year stint at Estée Lauder. “I love that this is an industry where women are leaders,” Crowell says about working in beauty. “They’re running these companies, and the majority of our consumers are women. I love how unique that is.” In honor of Saie’s long-awaited bronzer launch, Crowell dishes on how her skin-focused company has made its mark, the difficulties of being a female founder, and her take on the controversial term “clean beauty.”  My first job was right out of college as an assistant to a movie producer in Los Angeles. It was such fantastic training, because [people in] the entertainment industry, specifically the assistants, are held to really high standards. You’re thrown in with the sharks, and you just have to figure it out. It helped me be extremely organized. And always find a solution. That’s one of my biggest tips for people starting out: There’s always a solution. Rewire your brain to know that, and always come to your boss with the solution to the problem. Your solution might be wrong, but a great boss will help you figure out the right one. But never just show up with the problem.  I didn’t love being an intern at Gucci, because I just don’t think high fashion is my passion. But that’s what got me my internship at ELLE, which opened so many doors. So I don’t think I ever had a worst job. It always takes you to the next thing.  I distinctly remember Amber Valletta on the cover of Allure and just being completely transfixed with her face, the makeup look that they did. It was a true no-makeup makeup look. I remember buying the magazine and bringing it home. I was in elementary school, and my dad was like, “I don’t think you should be reading that.” But I was hooked from that moment on. I moved to New York with this dream of working in magazines. I immediately went into fashion, not knowing how the beauty departments worked. I became really good friends with the beauty assistant when I was at Lucky. She just started telling me about everything, and I would spend more time in the beauty closet that I would spend in the fashion closet. I was obsessed with trying every single new product and learning about what made products different. What was the innovation? How do you apply it? So when I got a job offer from Estée Lauder to start their social media channels, I jumped at the chance. It was a dream job. I left Estée Lauder with this really big idea of beauty being better. What would that mean for beauty to be great for our bodies, our minds, our souls, our hearts, the planet? And I started a blog to have that conversation that was called The Moment. I had so much fun writing that blog, because I got to interview so many incredible founders and have these really great conversations spanning nutrition, mindfulness, and then, of course, clean beauty. And pretty quickly, my community said, “Can you create something? Here’s exactly what we’d want it to be: Products that are high-performance at a great price point that are exciting and are good for our planet.” A huge hurdle to have to get over is the fact that there’s such a small percentage of investment that goes to women. It’s a lot of convincing. But really, for me, it was just perseverance. I kept telling myself that I had to keep going until I got it done. And that was my mantra. I wouldn’t take no for an answer. [Investors believed in me because] I was bringing the big beauty expertise to clean. That really had not been done before. My background at Estée Lauder just provided this incredible platform to bring world-class formulas to the clean market.  To me, clean beauty means formulas that are safe for your body and the environment. How do we have every single ingredient in our formula serving your body? How are we hydrating your skin? How are we brightening with ingredients like licorice root? We start all of our formulas with SFAC, which is Saie Fatty Acid Complex. It allows us to penetrate your skin barrier, so our formulas aren’t just sitting on top of your skin. We’re able to get down to those deeper layers of your epidermis and deeply hydrate with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, shea butter, and jojoba esters—these really beautiful, nourishing ingredients. The flip side of that is your skin looks gorgeous, dewy, and hydrated, as opposed to having silicones or petroleum-based ingredients that are just going to sit on the top of your skin and clog your pores.    I got ready for this 10 A.M. interview at 9:55 A.M. I put on Saie Glowy Super Gel, Slip Tint, Dew Blush, Glossybounce, Mascara 101. I got ready in three minutes. Every single time I put on Slip Tint, I get butterflies. It’s so hydrating. It evens your skin tone out immediately. It plumps up your whole face because of all that hydration—and it has SPF 35. It’s the best. How I created Saie’s first liquid bronzer  All of our products come from our community. That’s where the name of our brand comes from—you say it, we create it. We have been getting a lot of requests for a liquid bronzer inspired by Dew Blush, so that’s what we started working on. This formula has silica in it, so you get this really gorgeous airbrushed look but with all of that gorgeous hydration that you also get in Dew Blush. I am a California girl. I just love that California look, so bronzer is a product that’s always been a mainstay for me. And I’m not a makeup artist, so our formulas are effortless. I wanted to create something that instantly melts into your skin, is so easy to apply, and achieves that really cool-girl, surfer look. And it was definitely inspired by our viral Dew Blush. The formula is not the same, but the experience is similar. You have this fantastic chunky doe foot that can actually allow for a pretty precise application. I named all of the shades after my favorite parts of summer. I have worked out of my bedroom for years. Designing my office, I wanted it to be really feminine. I wanted it to be really calming. I wanted it to be full of wellness opportunities for myself. So I have my meditation pillow where I can go and meditate at the beginning of my day or if I have a break in my schedule. I have my walking pads so I can get my steps in and be standing. I have a bulletin board with all the art that my girls make for me, so I get to look at that every day, which is just the best feeling. I have lots of water for hydration and my little supplement corner with electrolytes and focus gummies and all those things that make me feel good. I feel way more productive. I think it’s a better balance, because when I’m in my office, I’m focused on work. And when I’m done for the day, I can shut that door and then go and be with my family, and be really present there. We have some really exciting announcements coming around our commitment to fighting the climate crisis. That is part of our DNA. Every decision we make is through the lens of: How do we have the smallest footprint possible? There’s obviously no denying the climate crisis that we’re in. I’m really proud to be a brand that not only is conscious about it, but is actively fighting for a better future. We’re very vocal about our community and encouraging them to vote. Our merch is vintage. And then of course, we work with 1% for the Planet, amongst other incredible organizations like rePurpose, who are all fighting really hard to support our planet.

              " \"The NPR anchor pays homage to Holly Hunter’s iconic Broadcast News character with a custom ‘80s gown.  ELLE’s series Clothes of Our Lives decodes the sartorial choices made by powerful women, exploring how fashion can be used as a tool for communication. In her own words, Tamara Keith, NPR White House correspondent and host of this year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner, takes us behind the scenes of the custom gown she had made for D.C.’s biggest night.   In 2020, my family started doing a movie night. My parents, my brother, and my husband and I would watch a movie, and then do a Zoom call afterward to talk about it. Such a pandemic activity. It was not my first time seeing Broadcast News, but for whatever reason we decided to watch it again.   For as long as I remember, I’ve felt a real kinship with Holly Hunter’s character, Jane Craig—I both relate to and resemble her. She’s driven, with this incredibly strong and perhaps indignant sense of what journalism should be. She has a true dedication to journalism ethics. Her character is a TV producer, but I work in radio. Sometimes, we need to get the sound of something. Like the sound of cows mooing or the sound of the door opening. People are always saying, “Oh, let me recreate that for you.” I’m the one who replies, “No, sound is fact and you can’t just recreate it.” If the cows aren’t mooing, the cows aren’t mooing. We can’t make them moo.   Re-watching Broadcast News planted a seed in my mind: I should wear the same dress that Jane wore to the White House Correspondents’ dinner in the movie. I’m this year’s president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, which means that, for better or worse, it is my dinner. I picked the comedian, I’m writing all of the scripts, and I’m basically the host of the dinner. I told one of my fellow WHCA board members about the idea to wear the Jane Craig dress and she loved it. So after a lot of Googling, I found what I thought might be a similar dress on eBay.  It was really close. But it wasn’t it. It was too small and tea-length, instead of floor-length. The neckline wasn’t quite right. It was from the 1980s, and the fabric had not held up well. On a whim, I sent a note and a still from the movie to a local wedding dress and evening wear shop called Zoya’s Atelier. They do custom dresses and significant alterations. Amy, who manages the store, was so excited. She said, “Here are three wedding dresses that have a similar neckline. Let’s try them on, let’s figure out the one that’s right, and then we’re going to get it made in the fabric that matches the movie.”  London-based designer Suzanne Neville custom-made the fabric. They used an image from the movie to measure the polka dots and made sure it matched exactly. I didn’t hear anything after that for a really long time. I started to get nervous. But behind the scenes, magic was happening. My first fitting was on March 29. I’ve had three more since then. We got the bow into the right position, put some extra lining inside to make the waistband more comfortable, and hemmed for length. It’s just so perfect. I can’t get over how close it is to the dress in the movie, and how great it feels.   I start my main speech in the dinner talking about the dress and what the movie did for me when I first saw it as a teenager. It showed me what a career could look like—that there was this place far, far away where news is life and where people take politics and journalism very seriously.  Part of my goal with the dinner and my speech is to convey to the public that we are all just regular people with dreams who have somehow ended up in this big ballroom wearing big ball gowns and tuxedos. The dress represents a dream of a career that, somehow, through hard work and a lot of luck, actually happened. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " \"ELLE’s series Clothes of Our Lives decodes the sartorial choices made by powerful women, exploring how fashion can be used as a tool for communication. Below, in her own words, Olympic boxer and fashion model Ramla Ali shares the story behind her custom Off-White boxing robe—which she says gives her a confidence boost before a big fight. “When I first started in the sport, I wasn’t sure I deserved a robe,” Ali tells ELLE. “But after a while, I became more confident in myself and my abilities. I was like, ‘I’ve earned the right to wear this’” Walking into a boxing arena is a little like walking in a fashion show. You make a grand entrance. You don’t lock eyes with anyone. All you see is the ring, but everyone is looking at you. What you’re wearing sets the tone for the entire match. When you finally make it to the ring, the gloves go on.  “Ding, ding, ding.”  It’s time to de-robe and showcase all of your hard work.  It’s game time.  Female boxing is getting televised a lot more than it used to, and there’s at least one female fight on every undercard—which is huge. But the sport is still on the rise. What a boxer wears helps her get noticed. You want people to know you for your boxing, of course, but you do need to set yourself apart outside of the ring.  Last month at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, I needed to make a sartorial statement during my fight for my first professional title. With a venue that iconic, I wanted to collaborate with an equally iconic fashion brand. Working with Off-White felt like making history.  I always say, “Wear something good makes you feel good, because when you feel good, you perform good.”  I never felt better than I did wearing my custom blue and yellow robe from Off-White. The moment I put it on, everything changed.  Everything became real. It was like: “Now it’s time for me to show everyone who I am, and what I’m fighting for.”  The design process with Off-White was very collaborative. They sent options. I would say, “I really like this, but can we change this?” Or “Can we add this color?” I knew from the start that I wanted to incorporate a panther motif, whether it was on the robe, the shorts, the under-layer, wherever. A panther was a must. The animal has been synonymous with me ever since the start of my career. I am Somali, and on my country’s coat of arms there are two big cats. It was a way to blend my culture and my sport. Off-White sent a few color ideas, but a combination of yellow and blue stood out to me the most. It represents joy and happiness and power. We decided to incorporate the Spanish word “chingona,” which translates to “badass.” In the gym, all my coaches have started calling me chingona. It came out of nowhere, like, “Let’s go chingona!” Ever since then, they’ve called me that, because of how much I put into my training. The countless sparrings, the personal bests, and the endless training. I try to never complain. When Off-White asked if they could add Virgil’s name to my robe, it was a no-brainer. I never had the opportunity to meet him, but I’ve always been a huge fan of his work. It was even more special considering the fight fell during Black History Month. I was honored to wear his name.  Four weeks out from the big fight, I started to feel really sick. And it didn’t go away. One week out, I was put on antibiotics. I was given another course of antibiotics the week of the fight, because the illness still wouldn’t let up. A lot of people would’ve complained and been like, “I’m going to take the day off.” But I was bringing myself to the gym, and making sure I got a good workout in.  I still wasn’t feeling one hundred percent the morning of the fight. I remember warming up in the changing room, thinking, “I’m really f-d right now, but I’m going to try and hide it.” Boxing is mental, so if you tell yourself you are good, you start to feel good. I kept telling myself, “This feeling will pass. It doesn’t matter. Put the robe on. Make your way to the ring.”  After round two, I came back to the corner and told my coach, “My chest hurts.” He was trying to stay positive. “Don’t worry about it,” he told me. “We’ve got this in the bag, you’re doing amazing.”  I remember thinking to myself: Just survive this round, just survive this round, just survive this round.”  Then, in a blur, 10 rounds were done. I had won nine of them. Even on my worst day, I dominated a fight. I think it was partly because I was so positive going in, telling myself: “You can do this.”   The next day I was rushed to hospital, because I was in pretty bad shape. They did an EKG, some x-rays, and a nasal swab. I had a respiratory viral infection, and a partly collapsed right lung caused from pneumonia. The doctor was like, “I don’t know how you did it.” It gives me comfort knowing that I was able to channel my inner chingona. A lot of young women look up to boxers like me, because it’s something they aspire to be. I know they’re constantly watching me, so I have to act a certain way. Girls are quite impressionable, and I want them to see somebody who has no quit in them—somebody who goes out there and hustles for what they want and what they deserve. I want to show that you can be anything you put your mind to. That you can achieve anything you want to be. I especially want to inspire women who come from similar backgrounds. I want to show them that you can struggle and still rise above. If I can do it, you can do it, too.   I fled to the U.K. as a war refugee in the early ’90s after my eldest brother died in the Somali Civil War. He was struck by a stray grenade. My mom didn’t want the same fate for her other kids. Because I was born during the chaos of war, there was never any documentation of me being born. So I have no idea of my age, date of birth, or even the year I was born. Fast-forward to my teenage years, I was bullied in school for being severely overweight. I took up the sport of boxing to gain a bit of self-confidence. My family wasn’t necessarily overjoyed. I hid it from them for a number of years, because I felt like ignorance was bliss. When they found out, they asked me to stop. So I did, for a while. Now they’re my biggest fans.  Boxing has helped me learn to love myself again. That’s what the sport is all about. Loving yourself, loving who you are, loving your body, loving your skin. I would love to fight for a world title this year. That’s one of my biggest goals right now. I competed at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, and I haven’t decided if I want to go to the Paris 2024 Olympics. Going to the Olympics was one of my major goals when I started boxing, and I’ve done that. My next goal is to be a world champion. There’s no doubt in my mind that I can do it.  This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

              " \"The beloved pop-punk singer reflects on her most iconic album cover look, 20 years later.  It’s not complicated: Avril Lavigne remains one of fashion’s most revered style icons. The cover of her 2002 debut album Let Go kicked off a frenzy for goth couture that continues to influence today’s biggest stars, from Olivia Rodrigo to Willow Smith. The iconic image features Lavigne posing with her arms folded, with her hip angled slightly to the right amid the frenzied blur of Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood. She’s wearing a fuzzy cardigan, cargo pants, and chunky skater shoes. All black everything, of course, to match her heavily lined eyes. The look was muted, but it spoke volumes: Flip through any mid-2000s yearbook and you’ll see Lavigne’s impact on a generation of angsty Y2K teens (hi, it’s me!) all across the country.  ELLE’s series Clothes of Our Lives decodes the sartorial choices made by powerful women, exploring how fashion can be used as a tool for communication. Below, in her own words, Lavigne, who debuted a new signature collection with UK-based fashion brand KILLSTAR, shares the story behind her most iconic look—one we haven’t stopped obsessing over two decades later.  Let Go started everything for me. It connected me with a fan base that has now followed me for 20 years. I wouldn’t change anything about it. The album cover was one of my first photoshoots. I was so excited, but also had no idea what to expect. We started early. Getting ready for the shoot was just me using what I had with me. We were originally shooting inside, but my gut told me to walk outside and explore what the city had to offer. I had recently moved to New York, and I loved walking around, so I knew there were a lot of things to play with on the street in terms of background.  At the time, I was traveling a lot and literally living out of a suitcase. The suitcase was so big, I could fit into it. So, everything I wore on the cover came from what I had with me. The black sweater was a gift from my co-writer, Lauren Christy. I saw her wearing it and I loved it so much that she got me the same one for my birthday. The shoes were those fat Osiris skate shoes. I wore them in high school and brought with me to New York when I left to make my album. The shirt, belt, and pants all were pieces I had that I threw together that morning.  My final look was so true to my style then—which is to say that I didn’t think much about my style. I liked a lot of skateboarding stores at the mall and was into baggy pants, big hoodies, and fat skate shoes.  I was wearing what I would wear any other day and what felt natural to me. I just wanted to be comfortable and to feel like me. I didn’t follow trends, and the only place I shopped at were skate stores in Canada. We really didn’t have a plan for where we were going to shoot that day. We were walking around New York and playing with the different backdrops. The spot on Canal Street just felt right. I didn’t have much time to take the picture, because we were shooting on an active street with people going about their everyday lives. I just struck a pose that felt comfortable to me in that moment. It’s incredible how much the photo fits the whole vibe of the album. Looking through all the photo options at the end of the day, we all saw that one and knew it was the one. I will always have a deep love and connection to my debut album. My style has changed since then. It now ranges from tomboy skate to rock glam—all mixed with pieces of high fashion. I still stay true to my skate style, and I like to wear what is comfortable. I love wearing oversized hoodies, Dr. Martens, plaid skirts, and corsets. For style inspiration, I have been looking to high fashion and designers like Vivienne Westwood and Versace. This year, I launched  a brand new collection in collaboration with KILLSTAR. I approached designing the collection knowing that I wanted it to tie in with my album Love Sux. I wanted to utilize an orange and black color scheme. There were specific pieces that I wanted to see, like plaid skater skirts. But instead of a classic punk red and black, I wanted to see it in orange and black. What is cool about this collection is that every piece is something I would wear onstage. There is an incredible resurgence of artists paying tribute to pop-punk today. I love seeing this new generation take pop-punk and, not only make it their own, but also allow it to influence what they are doing. I am so excited about the direction the genre is heading. I love being a part of pop-punk’s past—and also a part of its future. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " \"Peltola is the first Alaska Native ever elected to Congress and the first woman to represent the state in the House. This August, Democrat Mary Peltola shocked the nation when she won a special election in Alaska, flipping a long-held Republican seat to become the state’s sole U.S. representative. In doing so, she also made history, becoming the first Alaska Native ever elected to Congress and the first woman to represent the state in the House. “It’s the honor of my life,” Peltola told ELLE.com shortly after she was sworn into Congress, where she’ll complete the current term before going up for re-election in the midterms. Photos from the swearing-in ceremony show the proud Yup’ik Alaska Native beaming, wearing a black dress, blue jacket, and most importantly, a pair of piilugguqs, traditional footwear of the Yup’ik people. “I wanted to pay tribute to the people who helped raise me, who always showed me love, and who would make things for me out of love.” ELLE’s series Clothes of Our Lives decodes the sartorial choices made by powerful women, exploring how fashion can be used as a tool for communication. Below, in her own words, Peltola shares the story behind her beloved shoes—which she plans to wear again if she wins this November. When I was sworn into Congress, I knew I wanted to wear something that paid tribute to the Yup’ik culture. Whenever I’m speaking, I try to make sure I’m being inclusive and talking in a collective way. But it’s also important that I accessorize in a way that shows I’m proud of where I come from, I’m proud of the people that I come from, and I’m proud of the values that I was raised with. Growing up, my mom’s stepsister would always make piilugguqs—in English, you’d call them mukluks—for me. Her English name was also Mary, but we all knew her as Angakaq, her Yup’ik name. She and her husband were really important members of my family, and she passed away about 15 years ago. The two of them didn’t speak a lot of English, but whenever I would come back from school in Colorado in the lower 48, they would ask me questions about what it was like down here. They were just really proud of me, and in wearing these, I wanted to pay tribute to the people who helped raise me, who always showed me love, and who would make things for me out of love. And I was really thankful that all of the women who came to join me for the swearing-in celebration wore theirs as well.  On the day of my swearing-in, most of us had on a certain style called ciivagualgek, which means “ones with the housefly emblems” or atrarutelgek, “ones with the designs going down on each side.” On the front, there are four or five of these fur tufts, which kind of remind you of a housefly. It’s a very common style for women, and to me, it shows that every living thing is of great importance to Yup’ik people, even the lowly housefly. Yup’ik skin sewing expert Chuna McIntyre told me that the emblem is also used because in the cold, winter months, they remind us of summer. These boots are a reminder of the cycle of the seasons—and they’re also a reminder of the cycle of life itself. I think it’s wonderful that everything, even the designs that we use, have so much meaning embedded in them. Even the way we decorate and use ornamentation reveals our values and our worldview. But using piilugguqs in this way is something I actually picked up from the younger generation. Traditionally, piilugguqs have always been worn in the wintertime when there’s snow and ice on the ground, as well as during dance ceremonies. But more recently, young people have started using them for special occasions, like high school or college graduations. It has become much more normalized, and I think it’s a wonderful way to invite our ancestors to be with us and thank them for helping us on our journey here. McIntyre also taught me that our ancestors are joyful at heart when they see us dressed properly; our ancestors see us through a veil, and their joy and happiness and goodwill transcends time and space. That’s what helps us on this side.  The other thing I love about our outerwear is that it’s a survival tool. One of the pieces of advice we all get [when making piilugguqs] is to keep your stitches tight. That’s really about survival and making sure the cold air can’t get in. Piilugguqs are insulated with grass and made with walrus skin, which is very hard, kind of like raw hide. You have to use your teeth to crimp them, so a lot of women who have been making these for a long time, some of their teeth are worn down from doing so. It takes a lot of dedication—and it’s not something you go into lightly. It’s also important to have a good mentor, because there are thousands of years of best practices. When you make a fur parka, there are so many tips and tricks that have been passed down over generations that make a garment more durable and form-fitting. Again, these aren’t just ceremonial things. These are things that have preserved us for thousands of years. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

              " \"Zac Efron and Joey King have undeniable chemistry as co-stars and admitted their expectations were exceeded when they finally met each other. From King confessing her initial nervousness meeting Efron (and revealing her collection of posters and merch with his face on them) to Efron sharing his most embarrassing on-set moment during his first kissing scene, the co-stars get hilariously candid.  As King explains what “the tea” means to Efron, the pair bond over their mutual admiration for Nicole Kidman and their dislike of skinny jeans.

              " 'Body-ody-ody on a budget.  Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. Amazon Prime Day, which runs July 16 and 17, is a fine time to shop for shiny, new things like a pair of headphones, home ware upgrades, or even some new fashion staples—any practical items that you want to save a few bucks on, really. But let’s be honest, there’s one wardrobe essential that shouldn’t be overlooked. You guessed it, shapewear. For some reason, the prices tend to be astronomical. But not during the global two-day shopping event. Why we’re expected to pay a small fortune for undergarments is beyond me. If I had it my way, a pair of hug-you-in-all-the-right-places shorts would come with every slinky little summer dress. It’s your right to feel your best! But I digress; at least for now, the most we can do is shop wisely, which means taking advantage of the best Amazon Prime Day shapewear deals. Below, I’ve rounded up the must-have options to shop ahead of the sale.  If you’re committed to leaving exposed underwear lines in the past, a seamless bodysuit style will help you do so while offering ample support.  Sizes: 2XS-5XL  Customer review: “This has become my secret weapon for feeling confident and comfortable all day long! This bodysuit is like a magic hug that smooths out unwanted bulges and creates a flattering silhouette. My tummy feels supported, and it even helps lift my chest for a more streamlined look! The seamless design is surprisingly comfortable, and the material is soft and breathable. Whether I’m rocking a dress or a sleek top-and-pants combo, it provides a smooth foundation.”  At the risk of sharing too much, a shaping thong is easily my most worn type of shapewear. If nothing else, get yourself one of these to try under that pair of jeans that are a little too tight.  Sizes: S-3XL  Customer review: “Lightweight but still well worth the buy! Very comfortable but gets the job done. Good stretch and good length. Doesn’t roll much at all. Definitely sucks you in! Overall great quality! 10/10 would buy again.”  For additional coverage, count on a bodysuit that comes with built-in shorts that hug you in all the right places. Sizes: XS-6XL  Customer review: “After the struggle of getting it over my hips (a little workout for sure), I found it to be extremely stretchy, comfortable, and held in what I wanted it to. I don’t have a natural hourglass shape—I’m more of an inverted triangle—but this hugs me well and gives me the look of having hips. I love the shape, the straps don’t dig in, and the overall performance from this fabric is great!”   Often, shapewear is just not meant to be seen. To be blunt, it’s unsightly. But this lacy bodysuit is quite the opposite, in my opinion.   Sizes: 36C-42DD  Customer review: “I have tried several shapers, and this one fits absolutely amazing. Go with your regular bra size. Firm control. I’m ordering another.”   While the sizing and selection is limited, it is definitely worth noting that Spanx is available on Amazon. Fans of the brand should remember to check for Prime Day sales.  Sizes: S-M  Customer review: “This thing is amazing. It gives me all the confidence I need! It holds your stomach and legs in and will have you looking really great.”  This is perfect to wear under jumpsuits or rompers, but even under dresses and skirts, the shorts will help guard against chafing.  Sizes: S-XL Customer review: “I was a bit apprehensive about it, but the difference in the way an outfit looks and the snug feeling of everything being pulled up and in was SO satisfying! This is going to be my go-to for days when I just need a bit of a boost in confidence.”  Lots of women consider layering to be a lifestyle and hardly wear anything without a camisole underneath. If you relate, you might be interested in trying a tank with a bit of compression.  Sizes: XS-4XL  Customer review: “Very good fabric with comfortable stretch, and holds you in the right places. Thickness of fabric is perfectly opaque. It keeps your curves smooth and tidy without too much constriction in the bust area, making it very comfy to wear all day.”   My mother taught me that one should always have a reliable slip at the backbone of my closet. Sizes: S-3XL  Customer review: “I bought it for under a lightweight black dress to help smooth things out. I’m a curvy girl, and this doesn’t bind or compress, but it smooths out the bumps and is very comfortable. I feel great wearing this slip.”  If your blouse or dress features a neckline with some va va voom, fear not. There are plenty of open bust shapers available on Amazon.  Sizes: XS-4XL Customer review: “As awkward as this may be to get on, it is completely comfortable and makes you look snatched!”  Shoppers say these shorts provide more smoothing than shaping. So, if you dislike highly compressive materials, this might be the option for you.   Sizes: S-4XL  Customer review: “They do NOT shape in the traditional sense of the term; they also don’t lift or shape the butt at all. However, these shorts smooth you nicely while being very comfortable and breathable—no more bumps and rolls. The waistband didn’t roll down or need adjusting at all, even through dropping it low on the dance floor. So depending on what you’re trying to accomplish with a shaper short, give these a try!”   Now here’s an idea: built-in shapewear. This slinky black maxi has a shaping playsuit built-in. I’ve already added it to my own cart.   Sizes: XS-4XL  Customer review: “This is well worth the money! There’s removable padding, slimming lining on the inside, and a slit for you to go to the bathroom with ease. It’s the perfect versatile dress that can be dressed up or down.”  It doesn’t have to be a big occasion to break out the shapewear; wear this weekly under your favorite work skirt.  Sizes: S-2XL  Customer review: “Great piece to have! This is made well and definitely helps to smooth out the body, making clothing much more attractive on. It does come all the way up to the bottom of my bra.”  Give me one reason I shouldn’t start wearing this under literally everything. I’ll wait!  Sizes: 2XS-5XL Customer review: “Comfortable while holding everything in place. It  contours my curves, and the material is durable. It keeps its tightness after a gentle machine wash. The hole provided for easy bathroom use is a plus.”   Every product featured on ELLE.com is independently researched, tested, or editor-approved.

              " \"It might be time for someone to call up some distant relatives.  Spoilers below.  The fires from last week’s Battle at Rook’s Rest are fizzling out. In season 2, episode 5, as King Aegon lies broken in bed and Corlys Velaryon wallows in grief, the battles take place on negotiating tables instead of castles. And often, especially in the case of Queens Alicent and Rhaenyra this week, the women are on the losing side. House of the Dragon has been more women-centric than Game of Thrones, but the female characters in this universe, even those in power, still have to battle rampant sexism. We might have princesses and queens in play, but this episode explores (rather unsubtly) how the patriarchy still rules.  In the aftermath of Rook’s Rest, Corlys Velaryon grieves the death of his wife, Rhaenys, on Driftmark. Meanwhile in King’s Landing, the severed head of her dragon, Meleys the Red Queen, is paraded through the streets as proof of Aegon’s bravery and an example of what happens to his traitors. But the townspeople are more fearful than celebratory. They see the dragon’s head as an omen. Queen Alicent Hightower and Aemond watch from the Red Keep, focusing on the crate discreetly carrying Aegon’s body. When Alicent notices his Valyrian steel dagger on Aemond’s belt, she knows he was involved somehow. It’s a gruesome scene as Aegon gets treated in his room. The grand maester and his servants have to manually peel off the Valyrian armor that has melded into and scorched Aegon’s skin. He has many broken bones and burns covering half his body, but he is not dead—yet. Grand Maester Orwyle is unsure if and when Aegon will ever recover. Aemond wastes no time in declaring that someone will have to rule in his brother’s stead. In Dragonstone, Rhaenyra is also grieving Rhaenys, but she’s cautious of the greens’ next move. Ser Alfred, a particularly misogynist member of her council says the “gentler sex” has no knowledge of combat. Rhaenyra swiftly reminds him that he’s been in as many battles as she has. Her council says they must strike King’s Landing in retaliation, and Rhaenyra insists she do it herself. But her advisors say that as the queen (and as a weak woman!), she shouldn’t.  Her son, Jacaerys, is also antsy at home. He decides to see the Freys. He’ll try to convince them to give Cregan Stark’s army passage at the Twins, so they can enter the Riverlands without having to wait for Daemon at Harrenhal. Does Rhaenyra know of this plan? Nope. Speaking of Daemon, he’s with Willem Blackwood, forcing his rival, Lord Bracken, to denounce Aegon and pledge himself to Queen Rhaenyra. Lord Bracken would rather die by dragon fire than bend the knee, but Daemon doesn’t let Caraxes burn him and his men. Daemon needs to build an army, and he can’t do that with dead bodies. He instead allows Willem to organize his own revenge on the Brackens, by suspicious means. In the Vale, Daemon’s daughter, Rhaena, has arrived with the (tiny) dragons promised to Lady Arryn, who’s unhappy with their size.  Rhaenyra vents to Mysaria about being pushed aside by the men at her table. “They speak around me, not to me,” she says. She even thinks they have a point: Viserys might have named her heir, but he didn’t teach her how to fight in battle. Must she keep depending on Daemon for brute strength? But Mysaria reminds her, there’s more than one way to fight a war. Rhaenyra could use the turning of public opinion in King’s Landing to her advantage. The townspeople are already disgruntled by the economic impacts of the war, plus the sight of Meleys’ head and Aegon’s fate. Maybe she could appeal to them. Rhaenyra sends her servant girl to King’s Landing on a mission. The queen also chats with Baela as they reminisce about Rhaenys. With her gone, Rhaenyra will have to rely more heavily on Baela now. She sends her to deliver something to Corlys at Driftmark. Back at Harrenhal, Daemon has his most disturbing vision yet: He’s in bed with a beautiful blonde woman who showers him with praise—and she turns out to be his mother. (Classic Targaryen behavior, I guess?!) Before the realization sinks in too far, Ser Simon Strong calls him out to dine and, eventually, ask for charity. Strong mentions that Larys took all of Harrenhal’s gold to King’s Landing, and there’s barely any money left to keep the household afloat and cover much-needed renovations. Ser Simon hopes Rhaenrya can offer the money. But Daemon, intent on proving his dominance, offers to sponsor Harrenhal himself. At the green council meeting, Alicent is also being shut down by the men around her. She volunteers to rule in Aegon’s place as regent; after all, she did it while King Viserys was sick. While Orwyle seconds her petition, the rest vote for Aemond because he’s “Aegon’s immediate successor” (read: not a woman). Even Lord Larys and, ouch, Alicent’s sneaky link Ser Criston Cole side with Aemond. As Aemond promptly takes a seat at the head of the table, the camera lingers on Alicent, seething in her chair. She later confronts Cole: “Has your loyalty faded? Or does it flourish only at night and flee the sunrise like a moth?” (Finish him!) Elsewhere in King’s Landing, Hugh Hammer’s daughter has fallen even more ill. He must choose between fleeing the city with his family to make a better life, or staying put. He picks the former, but it seems the rest of the town has the same idea. A swarm of townspeople try to leave, but the gates are closed—per Aemond’s orders. Jace meets with the Freys at The Twins. They want Harrenhal now that Larys is no longer there. Jace says, for that, the Freys will have to offer passage to the Stark army and bend the knee to Rhaenyra. Of course, he doesn’t know that Daemon is now involved with the Strongs at Harrenhal. Daemon’s even doing manual labor, chopping wood to help with reno. Alys Rivers, eerie as always, tells him that she’s heard word of “crimes against the innocent” happening to the Brackens, which Daemon might have allowed. As Alys questions Daemon, he lets his true feelings about Rhaenyra known: that she cannot succeed and the people who support her won’t be led by her. “They look to a man for strength,” he declares, in a rather obvious line. Then he shares with what he really plans to do: “When I take King’s Landing, Rhaenyra is welcome to join me there and take her place by my side.” He says they would rule together though—how nice, some equality as a treat. Soon after, news arrives: Lord Amos Bracken has pledged his banner to Daemon. Then, finally, more Corlys. You would think that after he lost his beloved wife in battle last episode, that we would see more of him this week, but for the most part, the  Sea Snake has been grieving off-screen. When his granddaughter, Baela, arrives to offer him the role of Rhaenyra’s Hand of the Queen, he thinks it’s an insult. He’s feeling lost. But Baela tries to get him to understand that Rhaenys died with honor. In fact, it was her wish to see Rhaenyra rightfully on the throne, and she wants to respect that. Corlys wants to name Baela the heir of Driftmark (as Rhaenys had suggested!), but she tells him to stick to tradition: She’s of blood and fire, and the heir to Driftmark must be of salt and sea. Rhaenyra sends Ser Alfred to Harrenhal to seek out Daemon’s true intentions. (She senses something’s off.) It’s also a great way to get him out of her hair. Daemon is woken up in the night by angry Riverlords. They are disgusted by the brutal acts the Blackwoods have committed to the Brackens—looting and burning their septs and farms, stealing livestock, pursuing women and children—and declare they will not bend the knee to Rhaenyra. But Daemon can’t concentrate, as his late wife, Laena, appears to him again. “Have you looked after our girls?” she asks him. A valid question! In King’s Landing, Rhaenyra’s servant, Elinda, looks for an “old friend.”  Aemond gazes ominously upon the Iron Throne. His sister Helaena asks him, “Was it worth the price?” She probably knows  Aemond is responsible for Aegon’s injuries. Upstairs, Alicent watches over Aegon in bed. When she leaves, he calls after her under his breath, “Mummy.” A different kind of mother-son meeting happens in Dragonstone. Jace reports back on his meeting with the Freys, and Rhaenyra approves. However, she’s itching to take action and running out of people to act for her.

If only there were more dragons…  Well, luckily they have plenty of dragons, Jace points out, and two of them are large enough to fight Vhagar. (Hello, Vermithor and Silverwing.)  If only there were more dragonriders…  Jace suggests there might be a fix for that too. What if they found dragonriders from within the Targaryen line, distant relatives who had married and bred with other houses? “It’s a mad thought,” Rhaenyra says. It might be worth a shot.  If this plan works out, Rhaenyra will finally be able to delegate, and, for book readers, the Dragonseeds will finally come into play. What Happened to Aegon Last Night?

              " \"The first season of The Acolyte was helmed by showrunner Leslye Headland, who seems eager for a second season of her Star Wars universe show. However, there has not yet been any indication that one is coming, despite trending interest in Manny Jacinto. Here’s what we know about the possibility of a second season so far. When the show was announced in 2020, LucasFilm President Kathleen Kennedy, described the show on Disney Investor Day by saying, “The Acolyte is a mystery thriller that will take us into a galaxy of shadowy secrets and emerging Dark Side powers in the final days of the High Republic era.” The series follows a Padawan who seeks out her former Jedi Master to investigate a series of Jedi murders. That Padawan is Amandla Stenberg, playing both Osha and Mae, twins who were split from one consciousness using the Force. And Osha appears to have some romantic feelings for Jacinto’s Qimir, which could be a key point if the show gets a season two. In season one, the show starred Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Charlie Barnett, Dafne Keen, Rebecca Henderson, Jodie Turner-Smith, Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, Dean-Charles Chapman, Joonas Suotamo, Margarita Levieva, Lauren Brady, Leah Brady, and Harry Trevaldwyn. Anyone who lives through the first eight episodes could potentially make a return. In an extremely in depth interview with Nerdist, Headland promised a satisfying conclusion to the first season while implying there’s still a lot more story she’d like to unpack.  “We definitely aren’t going to leave you hanging,” she said. “You do a show like this, you take a lot of risks, you don’t really save a lot of those types of questions for season two.” When asked, “Do you know if you’re definitely getting a season two?” She laughed and replied, “No!” then continued, “I have no idea. Well, not that I have no idea. I would say there are conversations. And I don’t know when that will happen. I don’t know when that decision will be made.” This post will be updated.

              " \"Taylor Swift had shows in Milan, Italy, on July 13 and 14, but her boyfriend Travis Kelce was not in the audience. The NFL star was back in the U.S. as of last week. On Friday, he played at the American Century Championship golf tournament alongside his brother, Jason Kelce.  He was caught dancing to a remix of Swift’s “Lavender Haze” on the 17th hole, in a video shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. The event was held around Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and while they weren’t together, they were thinking of one another. That same evening, Swift liked a post that named Kelce the number one tight end in the NFL. “ESPN polled coaches, executives and scouts for their top 10 Tight Ends in the NFL with Travis being ranked 1st in the league!” the post on Instagram read.  And at the celebrity tournament, Travis also thought of Swift after winning a karaoke contest for his performance of Whitesnake’s “Here I Go Again.” In his acceptance speech, he told the crowd, “Taylor, this is for you.”  Kelce just returned from a trip to Europe, attending Swift’s shows in London, Dublin, and Amsterdam. He even appeared on stage during one night at Wembley Stadium, playfully vamping on stage with his girlfriend while wearing a top hat and full tuxedo. He eventually carried her off stage during the transition skit finale. Soon, he’ll be heading to training camp ahead of the next NFL season. A source told People earlier in July that Kelce tries to make Swift feel special even when they are separated.  “Football is definitely still his priority, but so is his relationship,” the source explained. “He makes romantic gestures to show he’s thinking of her when they’re apart. She’s going to try to attend as many games as possible.” Will There Be a 'The Acolyte' Season 2 All About Malcolm, Anya’s Husband All About Emma Roberts’ Boyfriend, Cody John A Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ Love Jeremy Allen White & Rosalía’s Timeline Zendaya Wears Second Blazer Look to Wimbledon Princess Charlotte Wears Cute Polka Dot Dress All About Vittoria Ceretti & Leonardo DiCaprio Kate Middleton Wears Lavender Dress to Wimbledon Justin and Hailey Bieber’s Relationship Timeline A Timeline of Taylor and Travis’ Whirlwind Romance A Timeline of Zoë Kravitz and Channing Tatum A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

              " \"On Sunday, Zendaya returned for another Wimbledon game after her first appearance on Saturday afternoon, once again sporting a Ralph Lauren blazer. This time, the Challengers star was wearing a white coat over a blue and white striped button down shirt with a knit navy blue tie. The Spider-Man actress had her blonde hair down with a side part and wore a silver ring and diamond studs for jewelry. She had on a no makeup look with pale pink lips and a slight shimmer of eyeshadow. The day before, Zendaya was in another blazer look, this one slightly more casually styled with a tweed jacket. She wore her blue button-down open at the top and bottom and the striped blue and white tie was loosely knotted around her neck. She had her hair up in a curly ponytail with tendrils framing her face and wore pearl earrings set in gold. Sunday’s match between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz was attended by a huge number of celebrities, including Julia Roberts, Tom Cruise, Courteney Cox, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Kate Middleton, who has made very infrequent public appearances as she has been receiving treatment for cancer. She was accompanied by her daughter, Princess Charlotte, and Kate was met with a standing ovation as she entered the Royal Box for the big event. Zendaya has been seen frequently in London the past month as her boyfriend and Marvel co-star Tom Holland is starring in a production of Romeo and Juliet at the Duke of York Theatre in the West End. Holland’s career began on stage with the musical production of Billy Elliot. In June, she was seen leaving through the stage door with him after the show. In April, Zendaya told Vogue that she “could not be more proud” of Holland’s work on the Shakespeare production, adding, “I’m going to try to see as many shows as I possibly can.” Will There Be a 'The Acolyte' Season 2 Travis Kelce Won't Be at Taylor Swift’s Milan Show All About Malcolm, Anya’s Husband All About Emma Roberts’ Boyfriend, Cody John A Timeline of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ Love Jeremy Allen White & Rosalía’s Timeline Princess Charlotte Wears Cute Polka Dot Dress All About Vittoria Ceretti & Leonardo DiCaprio Kate Middleton Wears Lavender Dress to Wimbledon Justin and Hailey Bieber’s Relationship Timeline A Timeline of Taylor and Travis’ Whirlwind Romance A Timeline of Zoë Kravitz and Channing Tatum A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

              " \"On Sunday, Princess Charlotte joined her mother Kate Middleton for the second year in a row at a Wimbledon game, this time to see Carlos Alcaraz face off against Novak Djokovic in the Grand Slam. For the event, Charlotte wore a navy blue dress with white polka dots. It featured short ruffled sleeves and a tiered skirt that ended just above the knee. She wore the dress with nude flats and had her hair partly up in two braids connected at the back with a navy ribbon. In the audience, Charlotte appeared engrossed by the game, leaning over at times to talk with her mother and pointing to the tennis court. She wore a pair of pink frame sunglasses with pink tinted lenses. The Princess of Wales received a standing ovation when she entered the Royal Box at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. This was Kate’s second public appearance since announcing that she was receiving treatment for cancer. She also attended the annual Trooping of the Colour with Prince William, Princess Charlotte, and her sons, Prince George and Prince Louis. For her return to tennis, Kate wore a lavender purple dress from Safiyaa, with puffed sleeves and a long skirt. She accessorized with nude pumps, gold jewelry, and a small white purse. At the much more formal Trooping the Colour parade, Kate wore a white Jenny Packham dress with a navy and white bow accent around the neckline, matching white heels and a large round hat pinned high on her updo. The family watched the march from a balcony on Buckingham Palace with King Charles III and Queen Camilla. For that event, Charlotte was also in a navy dress, this one with a sailor collar in white and white ribbon trimming. She matched her brothers, who were both in navy blazers.

Kate is a patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club and has attended many games in years past. She wanted to be at the tournament earlier, according to a message she sent to Andy Murray upon his retirement. Murray unfortunately had to miss a final match at Wimbledon.

              " \"On June 12, Academy Award winner Emerald Fennell announced her next project with a tease on X, formerly known as Twitter, sharing an illustration with a quote from the Gothic romance by Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights. Alongside the drawing by artist Katie Buckley is a quote, reading, “Be with me always. Take any form. Drive me mad.” Beneath it, Fennell wrote, “A film by Emerald Fennell.” Here’s what we know about the new adaptation of the famous book so far. In Fennell’s hands, the material could take any number of directions. But the original story focuses on a conflict between two families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their lives in the Yorkshire countryside. At the heart of the story is the passionate romance between an orphan adopted by Mr. Earnshaw named Heathcliff and Mr. Earnshaw’s daughter, Catherine. It was quite forbidden and quite undeniable. It seems likely that Fennell will bring to life some of the original spirit of the book. She wrote in a January 2024 post for the Los Angeles Times that she has always had an interest in this type of material.  “I’ve always been obsessed with the gothic,” Fennell wrote. “Whether it was Edward Gorey’s children who are variously choked by peaches, sucked dry by leeches or smothered by rugs; Du Maurier’s imperiled heroines or the disturbing erotic power of Angela Carter’s fairy tales, the gothic world has always had me in its grip. It’s a genre where comedy and horror, revulsion and desire, sex and death are forever entwined, where every exchange is heavy with the threat of violence, or sex or both.”  There’s no news yet for casting.  There is no news yet of when production will commence.  This post will be updated. House of the Dragon Season 2, Episode 5 Who is Rachel Brosnahan's Husband Jason Ralph?

              " \"The Gilded Age has been a big hit for HBO and the network confirmed a third season just days after the second one finished airing. The Julian Fellowes creation follows old New York families with tons of money as they go through a huge cultural shift that changes their futures—and the future of the city itself. Here’s what we know about the epic show’s third season so far. Spoilers ahead. At the end of season two, it was revealed that Ada inherited a whole lot of money, meaning the Brook family is saved and her own power is on the rise. The Russell family is also struggling with the conflict between Gladys and Bertha. With a new rich family appearing on the scene (see casting below), it looks like more machinations and money moves are on the horizon. Viewers can likely expect to see recurring cast Louisa Jacobson, Denée Benton, Harry Richardson, Taissa Farmiga, Blake Ritson, Taylor Richardson, Carrie Coon, Morgan Spector, Cynthia Nixon, and Christine Baranski. The season three cast will include some new faces, like the great Phylicia Rashad as a recurring character named Mrs. Elizabeth Kirkland. Her description reads that she is  “a woman from a prominent family in Newport with ties dating back to the American Revolution who has high standards and an occasionally sharp tongue.” Brian Stokes Mitchell will play her husband, Frederick Kirkland, a pastor at a powerful Black church in the Newport community. Jordan Donica will star as their son, Dr. William Kirkland. Victoria Clark is set to guest star as Joan Carlton, described as a woman from “the old money side of New York high society.”   No date has been set yet for season three. \\ufeffIt appears so. Louisa Jacobson shared a post on Instagram in early July of her fabulous wig getting placed on her head in the makeup trailer. \\ufeffIn the caption, she wrote, “\\ufeffFIRST DAY OF @gildedagehbo 🥂SEASON 3🥂 LET’S GO.” This post will be updated.

              " \"In a new TikTok posted on Friday, Selena Gomez shared an intimate look into her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco. The video was literally taken on what appears to be their couch and they’re both dressed in casual clothing. Gomez looks luminous in no makeup and is wearing a white and beige halter top and cream pants, leaving her hair down. The video is set to a popular sound on the social media platform known as ‘Who’s Most Likely To’ in which a voice asks questions and the couple is supposed to answer honestly, seeing if they agree with one another. She grabs his attention to play the game and it starts with easy questions, first asking, “Who is most likely to fall asleep during a movie?”  Both of them seem to think they fall asleep first, perhaps because they’re not awake to figure it out.  “Who eats the most?” the voiceover asks next and then they both point to Blanco. The voiceover continued, “Who’s the first to apologize during an argument?”  The pair gave an inconclusive answer and they also didn’t know the answer to the next question, “Who spends more money?” In the heavier hitting questions, the voiceover demands to know, “Who said ‘I love you’ first?”  Gomez smiles and points happily to herself as Blanco wraps his arms around her and gives her a kiss. Next came, “Who takes longer to get ready in the morning?”  They seemed to each think it’s the other.  Another love question was, “Who is more romantic?”  Blanco boldly pointed to himself while Gomez shook her hands up and down to indicate more of a middle response. About who likes being the big spoon, Blanco showed it was him with another sweet embrace.  Gomez and Blanco have been dating publicly since December 2023.

The star was sitting in the Royal Box and wearing a preppy look, including a khaki Ralph Lauren blazer over a blue button-down shirt that opened just above the waist of her wide-legged denim pants. Around her neck, she had on a knit blue and white striped tie. Zendaya’s hair was up in a curly bun and her hair appeared to be a lighter blonde than usual.

In April on Instagram, she shared clips and photos of her and the film’s other stars, Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor. In her caption, she admitted to feeling nervous leading up to the movie’s release. “This is my first time leading a film in this way so ya girls been nervous but everyones excitement and encouragement has meant the world to me,” she said. “I’m so honored that I get to do this beside these incredibly talented, brilliant (and hilarious) people and on behalf of all of us, we hope you enjoy the film and again…try not to judge the characters too much lol but also #teamtashi.” She told The Hollywood Reporter of working with Guadagnino,“Luca is brilliant, and I’ve wanted to work with Luca for a very long time, and this just seemed like the absolute perfect thing.

She was also wearing elaborate jewelry around her neck and over her hair, which was loose down her back. Khloé wore a similar ensemble in gold and cream, with a tiered necklace. Her top was off-the-shoulder with long sleeves.

In the caption, Khloé wrote, “To the depths of the ocean, it’s me and you.” In these photos, Kim is wearing a white two piece with a cropped off-the-shoulder top and body hugging skirt.

Her lifelong passion for couture design led her to a dream role at a fashion magazine, where she curates all of the visuals to bring your fashion, beauty, and culture stories to life.

We describe below steps you can take to limit tracking of your activities and the delivery of targeted ads in browsers and mobile apps you use to access the Magazine Services. Please keep in mind that if you opt out of targeted ads, you will still see ads, but these ads will not be based on your inferred interests. In addition, if you take the steps described below, some automated means may still be used to collect information about your interactions with the Magazine Services for the other purposes described in this Privacy Notice (e.g., to remember user preferences or enable specific functionality). The technologies used to deliver ads on websites and mobile apps differ. Please also remember that opt-outs are browser and device-specific. Website (Browser) Opt-Out Mobile App Opt-Out Please keep in mind that as the mobile environment continues to evolve, additional opt-out mechanisms or privacy settings may become available to you. We encourage you to review the information on opt-outs and settings that device manufacturers, technology companies and industry associations make available to you. Do Not Track/Global Privacy Control Hearst does not currently take steps to respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals as no uniform standard to respond to such signals has been developed at this time. We do, however, respond to the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to the extent required by applicable law, and allow eligible individuals to convey opt-out preferences when we detect the signal. You can learn more about the GPC on the Global Privacy Control website.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories After weeks of inclement weather, the clouds have parted in London. It appears as though the sun’s rays have unanimously agreed to converge on the 300 acres of Stoke Park. Illuminated by nature’s spotlight, Sasha poses in front of a hedge brimming with rhododendrons under the watchful eye of celebrity stylist Law Roach. When Law tells Sasha to angle her face a certain way, she does. When Law pairs Hunter rain boots with Loewe autumn/ winter 2024 on Sasha, she happily obliges. When the hairstylist teases Sasha’s hair into a big halo of curls, she remains unperturbed. Even though Stoke Park is buzzing with the kind of activity to be expected from a Vogue cover shoot, Sasha seems to have found calm in the eye of the storm. When I chat with her over Zoom a week later, Law’s spell has worn off. Sasha’s hair has reverted to its blow-dried default and the runway fashion has been exchanged for a pink sweatshirt. Now, she is once again Isha Ambani Piramal, heiress, business magnate and member of the executive leadership teams at Reliance Retail, Reliance Foundation and Dhirubhai Ambani International School, in addition to occupying pivotal roles in a panoply of family-founded companies. Dress, boots; both Dior. Gloves, C’est Jeanne. Photographed by Micaiah Carter. Styled by Law Roach Yet despite owning and operating some of India’s biggest organisations, Isha insists that the curly coiffure was the furthest she has ventured outside her comfort zone. It’s why Law invented Sasha, an alter ego, who would hold her hand and help her get there. “He really wanted me to get out of my skin, so we did a bit of method acting,” laughs Isha. “I left my instincts and sensibilities outside the room when I entered and decided to follow whatever creative direction was being given.” She was a quick study, picking up on the nuances of a shot and wrapping up each look quickly before scooping up her phone to check on her kids. Fame and fortune aside, beneath her calm exterior, Isha is like most millennials: anxious and self-effacing. “I’ve been having sleepless nights,” she says, her hand instinctively flying towards her head in a gesture of self-assurance. “My natural hair looks like that, and growing up, I don’t think we ever celebrated having curls, volume or frizz. The way my hair was done for the shoot took me back to my tussles in school—we were always taught to oil our hair and comb it down so it wouldn’t look so out of control.” Then, she shakes her head to dispel the memories. “I think we all just need to be more comfortable with who we are.” Somewhere inside Isha, Sasha’s spirit nods approvingly. To her credit, blow-out or not, the 32-year-old has unlocked a new level of self-confidence lately, stepping into key roles at the mega opening of the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC) in March last year, followed by the Jio World Plaza launch in November. As head honcho at Reliance Retail, Isha has brought international brands such as Tiffany, Valentino and Balenciaga to India—names that Indians with purchasing power only had access to on their trips abroad. The glow of the limelight has percolated through her protective cocoon, pushing her to the front of the stage to address the crowd at every event as her parents applaud from the sidelines. “To build an institution in Mumbai like she’d seen in the West was a lifelong dream of my mother’s,” says Isha about the NMACC, her soft voice laced with fondness. Since it opened last year, the cultural centre has brought the works of some of the world’s most famous artists, such as Andy Warhol and Yayoi Kusama, as well as popular musicals, such as West Side Story and Mamma Mia!, to Mumbai, thereby redefining how locals spend their evenings outdoors. And if the chock-full Grand Theatre for the Matilda musical that just wrapped up is anything to go by, the NMACC has well surpassed expectations. “I don’t think we anticipated such a warm reception,” Isha concurs. “We’ve been living with this idea for so long. To see children coming and bringing their parents and grandparents along is very moving.” Gown, Richard Quinn. Photographed by Micaiah Carter. Styled by Law Roach It’s no coincidence that children come up in conversation when she speaks about work. Mum to twins Aadiyashakti and Krishna, Isha finds that thoughts of them permeate her mind all the time, be it while devising long-term business plans, planning her workday to ensure she and husband Anand Piramal are home in time to put them to bed or pencilling in playtime. For many, parenthood becomes an invitation to lean back into their silly side—an aspect of themselves they often shed on the road to adulthood. I ask Isha if that has been her experience too and she responds with a resounding no. If anything, it has made her take life more seriously. “I’m always thinking that there are these two little babies doing something somewhere and hoping that they’re okay. My doubts range from ‘Am I doing the right thing?’ to ‘Is it okay that we don’t have blackout curtains?’ and everything in between.” It’s to quell these doubts that women usually look to their mothers. In Isha’s case, perhaps the connection to her mum feels stronger now more than ever before as she embarks on her own journey of motherhood achieved through IVF, like Nita Ambani did with Isha and her brother Akash. “I’m very quick to say that my twins were conceived via IVF because that’s how we’ll normalise it, right?” she says, hopeful that talking about the subject more openly will make it less taboo. “Nobody should feel isolated or ashamed. It’s a difficult process. When you’re going through it, you’re physically exhausted.” After years of being inundated with questions about whether she wants children, Jennifer Aniston finally opened up about her unsuccessful fertility treatment in 2022, admitting how hurtful the unrelenting probing had felt. Before that, in her 2006 memoir Down Came the Rain, Brooke Shields wrote about her IVF journey reducing her to “a slave to the time of day and little vials of liquid”. Closer to home, celebrity pregnancies are microscopically scrutinised and debated in public. It’s almost Atwoodian that in a world where women have to endure pregnancy and childbirth to create new life, often at great personal risk to their own, their bodies become sites of scrutiny, ridicule and violence. The vitriol upholds the outdated notion of fertility as the most crucial marker of femininity and illustrates why women continue to undergo IVF cycles in secret. “If there is modern technology in the world today, why not use it to have children?” Isha asks. “It should be something you’re excited about, not something you should have to hide. If you can find support groups or other women to talk to, the process can feel much easier.” Coat, Benjamin Benmoyal. Photographed by Micaiah Carter. Styled by Law Roach The importance of female friendships is not lost on the Ambani scion who grew up with two brothers and eventually found her sisterhood through school, college and work. All these years later, she continues to hold them close. In fact, one of them was so dear to her that she went on to become family. “I was very lucky that the person who my brother decided to marry was my best friend, Shloka,” she beams, recounting the beginning of their classroom friendship. “Shloka became like my sister as we grew up. Even right now, we’re sharing the house in London and we joke that we’re actually married to each other because both Akash and Anand are in Mumbai and we’re here with the kids.” Has the addition of Radhika to the family completed the trio? “Anant has always been like the baby figure in my life, someone whom I’ve doted on, so I look at Radhika with a mothering eye. My mum, Shloka and Radhika are my closest confidantes and my first line of friends.” Isha carries this spirit with her to her workplace, where she’s actively trying to appoint more women at every level. “When you hire young women at junior roles, it’s so important for them to have senior female mentors to understand what their career progression will look like. I was 23 when I started working at Jio [telecommunications] and 90 per cent of the time, I was the only woman in the room.” One way to level the playing field, according to her, is to create equal opportunities for women by interviewing them for executive positions that have historically been ceded to men. “The NMACC team are mostly women. I had just given birth around the launch, and when I had to pump, no one batted an eyelid,” Isha recalls, underscoring her personal motivation to build her empire with women by her side. She also credits her strong support system at home for helping her transition into a working mum. “A mother has to take on a disproportionate amount of labour because there are a few things, like breastfeeding, that only she can do. But there’s a bunch of other stuff that both husband and wife can and must do when it comes to parenting.” Did Anand rise to the occasion? “I’m grateful to him, yes. He does the diaper changes and feeding. On the nights I have to stay up late or be away working, he makes sure he’s around so I don’t feel as bad.” Jacket, Louis Vuitton. Photographed by Micaiah Carter. Styled by Law Roach Isha swears by an anecdote ex-PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi once said in an interview about a woman’s biological clock and career clock being in conflict with each other. Her advice to new mothers, therefore, is to get the help they can afford and prioritise themselves postpartum. “It’s like they say during the safety briefing on a plane: put on your own oxygen mask first before assisting others.” There’s no denying that having the Ambani suffix to your name comes with an assortment of privileges, including an army of employees at your service to make life easier. And Isha isn’t pretending that being able to successfully juggle a career with child-rearing isn’t a function of the privilege that she was born into. But beyond the headlines about larger-than-life weddings, prestigious acquisitions, big-ticket launches and wearing a blouse adorned with real jadau jewels to her brother’s recent pre-wedding celebrations, the Ambani daughter, who graduated from Yale with a double major in psychology and South Asian studies, has an academic’s mind. When she speaks about what’s to come, we get glimpses of plans to bring Jio World Plaza to full occupancy and showcase grander art and culture spectacles at the NMACC. But what she’s most excited about is how the Reliance Foundation could shape the future of education in India. “The world is changing rapidly and schools need to change along with it,” she says, her eyes alight. “For our parents’ generation, libraries were a source of information. Our generation relies on the internet for referencing. The generation after us will have access to artificial intelligence outside their bodies. What is going to be the role of the human brain?” She pauses, then jokes about being prone to rambling when discussing her passions. I nod encouragingly and she picks up where she left off. “Today, it’s common in schools to see two teachers with a set of 30 students. In schools that have the budget and resources, you might see three to four. Their idea is to slot kids into groups and deliver a customised learning experience based on their capabilities. But shouldn’t every child learn at their own pace? How can we deliver education one-to-one rather than a one- to-15 ratio? What are schools of the future going to look like? These are questions I’m wildly excited about finding answers to.” Dress, hat; both Chanel. Ring, bracelet; both Bvlgari. Photographed by Micaiah Carter. Styled by Law Roach So many dreams ready for takeoff, plus prepping for Anant and Radhika’s nuptials and bringing up twins. Is ‘me-time’ a word in Isha’s dictionary at all? Does she, like many of us, spend hours going down internet rabbit holes only to emerge on the weird side of Instagram? “If I had a day with no commitments, I would spend it by myself, scrolling Instagram in a room with no noise and lots of sunlight,” she concedes, smiling cheekily. So can we expect her profile to go public and blue-ticked anytime soon? “I genuinely am an introvert and I guard my private life. I just don’t see how posting about what I eat in a day or who I’m meeting will be interesting to anybody.” A Vogue India reel demonstrating the making of her jadau blouse by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla that currently sits at 15.8 million views says otherwise, but let’s just say that this mama knows best.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories When the plane lurched violently in the middle of a cross-country flight, I clutched the armrest with one hand. With the other, I reached for my ear. Days earlier, wielding an oversized pair of tweezers, an acupuncturist at New York City’s WTHN clinic had affixed a constellation of tiny crystals to my outer ear. In a quiet, dimly lit room I felt a pleasing sensation when the crystals—each about the size of a large stud—were pressed against my skin. The seeds, as the crystals are called, are intended to stimulate the brain to send various signals to the body depending on their position. For instance, there’s a point near the inner flap to aid with digestion and another near the top for stress. Once secured, they evoke both the edge of Maria Tash piercings and ’90s star-shaped stick-on earrings. Midair, in heavy turbulence, however, pressing them serves a single purpose: calming me over the Rocky Mountains. I’m a lifelong sticker enthusiast, from validating gold stars to satisfying scratch-and-sniffs. My children mock me, but Hello Kitty stickers still adorn my laptop and birthday cards, as evocative to me as a tube of Bonne Bell Lip Smackers. (When I saw that Olivia Rodrigo had decorated her face with clusters of stickers for the cover of her debut album, Sour, I felt a kind of spiritual affinity.) But lately, stickermania has extended well beyond those of us who harbour a nostalgia for decor that once covered the insides of our lockers or the bottoms of our skateboards. The wellness-oriented stickers you’re now likely to encounter are of two general varieties. First, are the kinds designed to stimulate pressure points (those handy aids for my cross-country trip). Ear seeding (which gets its name from the Vaccaria seeds used by practitioners in traditional Chinese medicine) is “like taking your acupuncture on the go,” says Gudrun Snyder, the founder of Moon Rabbit Acupuncture in Chicago. Laura Sniper, a doctor of acupuncture at WTHN, often sends clients home with a set to prolong the effects: “They're working in the background,” she says, “while you’re living your life.” Next are transdermal vitamin patches that purport to deliver nutrients or other forms of sustenance (say, aromatherapy) by being affixed to the skin. Previously used to provide medicine or help people kick nicotine addiction, the new generation of patches addresses concerns ranging from stress, pain and menstrual bloating to dry skin and jet lag. Ideally, permeable patch ingredients “have the ability to pass through the epidermis, be absorbed by the blood vessels and enter the circulation,” says Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City (that’s an appealing prospect given that oral supplements can sometimes cause gastrointestinal side effects.) Both varieties are poised for an expansion. WTHN recently received $5 million (nearly 42 crores) in funding, and Meghan Markle went viral last year for wearing a blue, disc-shaped anti-stress wrist patch from the company NuCalm, which claims to activate an acupressure point (on the left wrist) that brings about relaxation. (The company reported a major spike in sales in the aftermath.) In January, London-based acupuncturist Ross J Barr, who has treated Markle and Prince Harry, released his Patch Pack for the first time in the US through Violet Grey. The aromatherapy adhesives—with individual patches designated for ‘calm’ or ‘sleep’—quickly sold out. When Claridge’s put his patches in its minibars, Barr says, they were outsold only by bottled water. Though inherently temporary, stick-on treatments could shift the beauty and wellness world more permanently. Cleo Davis-Urman founded her company, Barrière, in 2020 to produce stylish medical-grade face masks, but expanded to vitamins. (The company’s motto is: ‘Wear your vitamins. Feel better.’) In 2022, she was diagnosed as dangerously deficient in iron and B12. With Davis-Urman’s body failing to absorb capsule vitamins and insurance limiting coverage on injections and infusions, her doctor prescribed vitamin patches, which she quickly discovered was too bulky to fit under clothes and only available in an unappealing shade of medical beige. “It looked like something you would associate with being sick,” she says. Her solution: an array of temporary-tattoo-like decals said to contain particle-size vitamins and supplements, designed to pass through the skin and tissue and into the bloodstream. Davis-Urman now gets her daily dose of iron and B12 from bird or moon stickers, applied to any patch of clean, dry skin. Other stickers are geared toward skin health with ingredients like biotin and milk thistle, while a sheet of ‘travel well’ seashells purports to ease anxiety and inflammation with herbal ashwagandha or “nature’s Xanax”, as Davis-Urman calls it. I wear one of the travel well patches on my wrist before boarding my turbulent\\u2000flight, and despite the traffic, work jitters, and exhaustion, I just might feel uncharacteristically easygoing. Patch wellness is an emerging frontier, and, as such, data supporting its claims is limited. “They’re trendy, but more research is needed before we can assume that they’re effective,” says Jennifer Wider, MD. (She cites a small-scale 2019 study of bariatric surgery patients that found that those who wore multivitamin patches were more likely to be vitamin deficient than patients who took oral vitamins.) Wider is sceptical of the NuCalm disc’s product description “promising way too much,” she says. And as King pointed out, the list of drugs that we know can be transmitted transdermally is “very limited.” Our skin is a strong barrier; only very small molecules, like nicotine, have been proven to be successfully absorbed via patch. Barrière notes that its endorsement of herbal supplements like echinacea or ashwagandha has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates vitamins and supplements according to a different set of rules than those it applies to food—in many cases only evaluating products that have already hit the marketplace. (Barrière’s patches are produced in a UK facility registered with the British government’s main medical regulatory agency.) And the website for Barr’s patches includes disclaimers that they are “not a substitute for medicines or medical devices”. But, he tells sceptics, “things like aromatherapy have been around for thousands of years; nothing hangs around that long if it doesn’t work.” For Snyder, it doesn’t matter if ear seeding or a placebo effect is responsible for a greater state of calm: “It means it’s doing something for you.” There is a secondary effect to wearing our treatments on our skin: calling it self-care as self-expression and offering an opportunity to talk about anxiety, pain or hormone concerns. “It’s a big cultural shift to destigmatise the fact that we all struggle with something,” says WTHN’s Sniper. Over dinner in LA, I show off my ear seeds to my two friends and the conversation drifts into stress and therapy and the various challenges we’re experiencing. We hadn’t seen one another in years, but the emotional distance between us quickly narrows, a fresh candour facilitated by my openly worn admission, and that’s something I hope sticks. 12 beauty and wellness lessons to embrace for 2024 Quadrobics is a new fitness trend that boosts overall strength and agility In a wellness-first approach, Alaya F takes ice baths—here are the benefits of the practise See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories My mother believed that bathing in salt water has miraculous benefits. “The sea is health,” she would say, each summer of my childhood. During my teenage years, all I wanted to do was lie under an umbrella on the beach with my Walkman and magazines, but she’d urge me to\\xa0swim in the sea. It was her unending belief: “The sea is health,” she’d repeat. Of course, I know now that my mother was right. Though her eternal faith in the healing powers of the sea was based on generational wisdom, it aligns with a therapeutic philosophy called thalassotherapy. Derived from the ancient Greek word thalassa, meaning both \"ocean\" and \"primordial goddess of the sea,\" this practice forms the foundation of treatments at coastal spas. \"The nature of blood plasma is evidence of our marine origin. Chemical analysis shows that the same salts—potassium, calcium, magnesium—are found in equal proportions in seawater and human blood plasma,\" explain the therapists at the Marbella Club Hotel\\'s thalassotherapy spa, which features a seawater pool drawn from the Mediterranean. However, to fully absorb the minerals and trace elements in seawater, mere refreshing dips are not enough. Like many age-old traditions, there are secrets to reaping the maximum benefits of bathing in salt water. Below, is a peek into thalassotherapy and the best ways to apply the timeless wisdom of “the sea is health” to your daily routine. The ritual of absorption through the skin requires a minimum of 12 minutes in the sea. \"Our body cannot synthesise trace elements and minerals, so we need external sources by ingesting them in food and drink or absorbing them through the skin. Thalassotherapy balances the body through osmotic absorption, a natural process occurring in all living cells,\" explain the spa therapists. This process balances fluids in our body and offers numerous health benefits, which is why they recommend extending bathing time to 18 to 20 minutes. We\\'ve talked a lot about magnesium and its crucial role in our bodies, it has been shown to affect approximately 80 per cent of our\\xa0metabolic functions, helping to regulate everything from sleep to\\xa0blood sugar\\xa0and mood. When it comes to bathing in salt water, magnesium and other minerals in the sea are absorbed through hair follicles, offering numerous skin benefits. Pharmacist Marta Masi explains, “Magnesium helps protect the skin\\'s barrier and acts as an antioxidant against free radicals. It also relieves muscle and joint pain, promotes relaxation, and improves rest. Salt baths have been used for centuries to treat skin conditions.” When it comes to osmosis, the water must be at a specific temperature, as the Marbella Club Hotel team explains. \"For osmotic absorption to occur and for the substances in the marine environment to penetrate the skin, the water needs to be between 35 and 37 degrees, matching body temperature so the process happens naturally,\" they say. Salt baths have been used for centuries to treat skin conditions. Cold water baths also offer benefits, such as improving blood circulation, adds pharmacist Marta Masi. Bathing in the sea always has mental and physical advantages. \"It helps us relax, makes us feel good, and consequently improves our mood,\" Masi concludes. When it comes to luxurious floats, experts say that a quick dip in the sea, while pleasant, won\\'t give you all the benefits. To fully absorb the healthy minerals and trace elements in salty seawater, aim for at least 12 minutes of soaking time. \"Ideally, you should soak for 18 to 20 minutes,\" advises the team at Thalasso. \"This helps balance bodily fluids and enhances osmotic absorption.\" Can\\'t make it to a seaside spa resort? No need to miss out—it\\'s entirely possible to create a thalassotherapy experience at home. Use a mix of readily available minerals: magnesium- and sulfate-rich Epsom salts, baking soda, and either Dead Sea salts, Himalayan pink salt, or Celtic salt. Mix equal proportions and add a total of ¼ to 1 cup to your bath. (Just avoid iodized table salt, which can cause skin irritation.) 12 beauty and wellness lessons to embrace for 2024 In 2024 these wellness trends will reign supreme, according to experts In a wellness-first approach, Alaya F takes ice baths—here are the benefits of the practise See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast.

My partner is on the ground next to me, also panting heavily. We turn our faces towards each other at the same time, waiting for our breathing to stabilise. Our bodies are awash in sweat, our clothes are in disarray and our hair sticks out at odd angles. He gets on his haunches and holds his hand out to me, yanking me upright and into his arms. I smile lasciviously at him... before sticking up my hand and yelling, “Foul!” I send the ball sailing into the back of the net with my free kick, winking and mouthing: “Payback for that tackle at home,” when our teammates aren’t watching. Playing a sport with your partner has always been sexy. Long before Tashi, Art and Patrick’s racy threesome in Challengers, there was Jess and Joe (or Jess and Jules, depending on which team you bat for) in Bend It Like Beckham (2002) and Viola and Duke in She’s The Man (2006). In tennis (or even badminton, as seen in the iconic ‘Dhal Gaya Din Ho Gayi Sham’), it’s the suggestive, rhythmic grunting as you hit the ball back and forth which implies that seduction is in session. Thwack! (Pin my hands above my head) Thwack! (Lean in closer) Thwack! (Run your finger along the length of my neck). In a contact sport like football, however, every movement is precisely designed to mimic foreplay: perspiring bodies rubbing against each other, jerseys being pulled, tackles leading to takedowns. I was in college when I discovered that sports were aphrodisiacal to me. My then partner and I played football at university level and spent much of our time together at practice or discussing strategy. During matches, I would often find myself distracted watching my inamorata dribble past the opponents swarming around her. Suddenly, everything would become magnified: calf muscles tightening, hair flying in the wind, that sharp intake of breath before taking a shot at the goal. Afterwards, propelled by endorphins, we would review the game—and each other’s bodies—under the bleachers. It’s not surprising that taking up a sport together is recommended in couples’ therapy too. “At some point, we forget that we got into a relationship with our partner because it was fun and joyous. When we play together, it recreates that levity in our dynamic,” says Tanya Percy Vasunia. The published researcher and psychologist first excavates the issues in a relationship before proposing how to overcome a slump using sport. “If the problem is monotony, I encourage them to face off against each other to switch things up. On the other hand, if a couple just can’t get on the same page, I suggest playing on the same team.” Sports can often be an outlet for spite, perhaps grief too. An ex-boyfriend and I recently found ourselves at opposite ends of a ping-pong table for the first time, six years after we broke up. He refused to meet my gaze. Instead, he kept smashing the ball towards my face so that the game would end and he could make his escape. Maybe it dredged up some residual sadness from when we used to schedule table tennis dates in our early twenties. Muskan Kaur Sukarchakia, who was introduced to rugby by her partner, has a happier tale to tell. “Playing a sport with your partner gives you a chance to show off your skills to them and vice versa, which can be very attractive.” Although the assistant curator and her partner play the same sport competitively, they have never been at loggerheads. “We occupy different positions on the field so it allows us some distance. He takes on a more physical role while I, being slight and fast, play elsewhere and bring a different skill set to the game.” For those prone to over-competitiveness, Vasunia recommends getting to the root of the trigger via self-introspection. “The world is not a light place at the moment anyway, so looking for pockets of intimacy with your partner can make a huge difference.” As someone who first met her spouse in the sports council room of our college, I can attest to what Vasunia says. Often, our football kits play mediator in an argument because I can’t locate my studs and need his help finding them. When we are cooling down after a match, it fills my heart with joy to see him bask in the glow of a game well played. On our way back home, we always stop for frozen yoghurt or Bournvita and a long chat. Sadly, our sexy soccer sessions have been interrupted by a recent shoulder surgery he sustained while playing—and this is completely coincidental—tennis. And although this means he’ll have to watch from the sidelines for a while, we’ll meet—and sweat—in the virtual world of Mortal Kombat until he’s cleared to return.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To those who think the practice of reading tarot is an occult art reserved for spook sessions, let’s get this out of the way: you’re wrong. Like therapy, meditation and advice from friends, tarot is meant to be used for one thing and one thing only: connecting more deeply with yourself. “Tarot is not fortune-telling, it’s coaching,” explains Lori Dyan, a Toronto-based tarot reader and author of the book Burn Your Sh*t, The Life Changing Magic of Rituals. “Tarot cards are a tool for personal discovery and self-care. They highlight where you’ve been, validate where you’re at in the moment and hint at what’s possible. It’s a glimpse into the energetic landscape that supports you in making the best decisions for yourself moving forward. Tarot provides an opportunity to have a conversation with your soul; like a trusted counsellor that reflects you back to yourself. Tarot doesn’t do prophecies—it offers agency.” In uncertain times, gaining a stronger sense of personal agency is especially appealing—and healthy. It’s no wonder, then, that interest in tarot—along with astrology, numerology and other self-discovery practices—has grown significantly over the last several years. One need only to scroll social media briefly to experience the surge of divinatory and personal growth content in peak effect. Still, trying to enter into this vast world—of which there are centuries of literature—and learning how to read tarot cards on your own, can be daunting. “There are a lot of rules about tarot, which I think have been used in the past to keep people away as a way to protect the art form,” explains Rachel Howe, a Brooklyn-based artist, Reiki healer and tarot reader. “I don’t think that’s as necessary now; I think anyone can read tarot.” To that end, both Howe and Dyan have plenty of tips for those who want to learn how to read tarot cards themselves. Just keep Dyan’s most important advice in mind: “Your best resource for learning tarot is your intuition.” As Howe puts it: “Tarot is a tool—the real healing work is going to be done by the person.” First things first: you must procure a deck. While there are hundreds of gorgeous options to choose from—from Kim Kran’s now-iconic Wild Unknown to Matt Hughes’ shiny Ethereal Visions—most veteran tarot readers recommend starting with the classic Rider-Waite deck simply because the imagery is so descriptive. “Each of the 78 cards has a unique image with a specific message, and together they tell the story of you,” Dyan says. “If you asked me what the Six of Wands looks like, I couldn’t tell you—and I’ve done tens of thousands of readings over the past three decades—but, if you show me that card, I’ll talk about it for hours. Don’t worry about memorising each card; focus on learning the story it’s telling you.” And, don’t worry about another oft-cited tarot rule either: “I’ve heard people say you’re not supposed to buy your own deck; you’re supposed to have someone gift it to you,” Howe says. “But what if no one buys you a deck? Then you never get to learn how to read. My feeling is, I bought my deck and I can read!” After you’ve purchased your deck, the next thing to do is to familiarise yourself with the cards. “I think establishing a relationship with the cards is important. It can be so intimidating because it’s a deck of 78 cards and they’re all different,” Howe says. Her tip? “If you are starting out, just working by yourself, do a daily card pull where you pull one card from the deck and just think about the meaning of the card. If you do it in the morning, you can keep it in mind as you go through your day. That’s a nice way to get to know the cards on a deeper level.” Dyan agrees. She pulls a “card of the day” on Instagram every weekday morning and encourages others to do the same; she says it’s fine to use a guide book or online source (like Biddy Tarot) to help interpret the meanings. “It allows you to learn the story of the card while also receiving the guidance of the message in that moment,” she says. “A full one-hour reading with me can contain over 50 cards, but a single card can also give you incredible insight.” To work most effectively with the cards, Dyan says it’s important to ask questions in an open-ended way; you’re not looking for yes or no answers, but rather information to guide you. “Keep it simple and let the cards do their thing by asking something like ‘What do I need to know right now?’ Then, pull a card or two and see what kind of insight they offer,” Dyan says. Just as you want to keep the questions open-ended, you also want to keep an open mind—remember that the point is to gain a new perspective; to see yourself or a situation more clearly. To that end, Howe says it’s important to relax and trust your own wisdom: “Intuiting is definitely a big part of a tarot reading; that’s what makes it so special. Tarot is really a tool to facilitate talking about things. Use language that you already have, or knowledge that you already have, so you can see it less as ‘This holds all of these secret meanings that I have to do all this work to access,’ and more like ‘I know all the meanings; it’s just a matter of making the connections and being able to articulate them.’” The four elements—earth, water, fire and air—and numerology also play a large role in the tarot, which is helpful because most of us already have some ideas about those meanings that we can draw on. “If you do that, then it’s more your own perspective and you can be a little freer with your interpretations,” says Howe. Tarot is an age-old practice for a reason; each card is designed to make sense on an intrinsic level. “The reason a card can relate so specifically to multiple people is because tarot is rooted in archetypes that speak the language of the collective unconscious,” Dyan explains. “Our stories are told through archetypes, like The Fool or The Hermit, and they’re familiar to us because they exist in our energetic blueprint. Keep in mind that your interpretation of the cards is just as, if not more, important than the conventional explanation.” As with all experiences, set and setting—that is, your mood and your surroundings—are also key components to initiating an insightful tarot reading. While traditional tarot books or old-school readers might recommend using a lengthy ritual to start a reading, it’s best to do what feels right for you. “I think it’s important to think about the energy of the space because you’re opening up,” Howe says. “Burning sage, burning palo santo, lighting candles, and having an intention helps.” But it’s not just the physical space that needs to be balanced before a reading. “Even your headspace matters,” Howe says. “I like to meditate before I give a reading so that I’m not preoccupied, but you should do whatever ritual makes the most sense for you.” For beginner readers, Howe recommends two basic spreads, a three-card pull and the Celtic Cross. The former is where three cards are drawn from the deck to represent the past, present, and future. Once you get better, you can even up the ante to a six-card pull, with two cards representing each area. The Celtic Cross, though slightly more complicated, is also a traditional starting point. “The Celtic Cross spread is a classic spread where each card has an assigned position and an assigned meaning for that position. It’s 10 cards, so it’s a lot of information and it’s a very clear spread,” Howe says. However, keep in mind that there is no one “right” spread—it’s more important to keep the big picture in mind. “It’s really about the connections between the cards,” Howe says. “Depending on what cards are around a certain card, it will influence the meaning. They’re all being influenced by each other, sometimes they’re really amplified by each other.” Dyan says that it is best to “focus on the quality of each message instead of the quantity of cards pulled.” Remember, tarot is not predictive; it won’t foretell misfortune. “Don’t believe everything you see in the movies about tarot,” says Dyan. “The cards will not predict things that you have no control over; they will not predict death and cause despair—you have free will to create your own path using the guidance provided by the cards.” But if you do get a seemingly “scary card” like the Death card, don’t panic. “The Death card isn’t about physical death of any kind,” Dyan explains. “It’s about transformational change that is positive and necessary. How you deal with change is what determines if it’s positive or negative for you.” For this reason, both she and Howe say that the Death card is actually one of their favourite cards in the deck. “I really love the Death card,” Howe says. “It’s more about our fear of death and our fear of change. Change is really positive. Death is just the necessary component to transformation—you can’t become something else without the loss of something.” When it comes to tarot—and life, for that matter, intention really makes all the difference. “Just like a hammer can be used to hang a beautiful picture or smash a windshield, tarot is a tool that someone chooses to wield in a particular way,” Dyan says. “There are no ‘bad’ cards, only bad tarot card readers. Some cards are definitely more ‘fun’ or ‘sexy’ than others, but even the more challenging cards offer guidance, hope, or the kick we need. Tarot cards can’t hurt you; they inform you.” This article first appeared on Vogue.com How tarot is turning into a haven for queer Indians How tarot came to be loved by me, a lifelong sceptic How to use tarot for your personal growth based on your zodiac sign—even if you’re a rookie See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories There she is, in harmony with nature—international model Ujjwala Raut swiftly metamorphosing from jet-setting New Yorker into ocean nymph in a matter of seconds. Surrounded by the sands of The Sanchaya on Bintan island, a lush tropical paradise in the Riau archipelago of Indonesia, she can’t resist the happiness brewing inside. “What an invitation to pause,” she says. Yes, I agree, it is indeed a fertile place for daydreaming and introspection. Hers is a life of beauty—an everyday reality for someone cherry-picked by prolific designers like Tom Ford, Roberto Cavalli, Elie Saab, Diane von Furstenberg and others. As the waves kiss her feet, I am reminded of what Leo Tolstoy once said: “One of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between man and nature shall not be broken.” “For me, after years of travelling and modelling,” says Ujjwala Raut, “true luxury lies in how quickly I can decouple my body and spirit and slow down my mind. Somehow, real beauty today is simply a feeling of bliss.” There was a time when beauty was seemingly exclusive, a privileged combination of nature and nurture, with a limited perception that hadn’t yet been touched by the ethos of diversity we see today. Now the industry offers jaw-dropping variety, availability and affordability—replete with extraordinary products and cosmetic tools that empower us to correct outer ‘imperfections’ and present what we see as better versions of ourselves. But, I ponder, in this fast-paced world of endless corrections and cover-ups, what is the definition of beauty that is not skin deep? When ‘beautification’ is available to all, what makes someone stand out in a sea of good-looking people? “Well, I am quite certain there’s something to be said about inner luminosity and energetic vibrations that transcend physical looks,” says Raut. She has certainly lived the disco-ball life, attending fashionable shows and glamorous soirées alike. But with a bit of growing up, we both agree that a kind of magical transformation takes place when we recognise the critical difference between the fast and explosive pace of outer beauty and the slow, everlasting presence of inner beauty. I have observed this in those who have matured and perhaps become a little wary of the ‘fashionable’ life, using conscious inner engineering to slow down their overactive minds and hyperactive activities. It is the state, Osho explained, when one drops out from the ‘mob mind’. “Slowing down takes my mind from hastily reacting to a situation to mindfully influencing it,” says Raut. Living the ‘soft life’ is the new aspiration. The opposite of hustle culture, this movement encourages us to be mindful of the present moment, elevating ordinary experiences and minimising stressful interactions. World over, we see how this form of barefoot luxury is embraced in how we dress, eat and travel, prioritising slowness as a reaction to the hamster wheel of speed and greed which says that to be or not to be is not the question. It is, in fact, to be and to be more. We know better today that chasing, acquiring and disposing corrodes the human spirit, but the tenacity to savour the luxury of small things—a tequila sunset, a home-cooked meal, the embrace of grandmothers—allows us to own our power and commandeer life experiences with joy and fulfilment. The Dutch have a word called Niksen, the practice of doing nothing, which allows a swift ascension into owning your bliss by surrendering to ‘nothing-ing’. The executive chairman of LinkedIn, Jeff Weiner, is said to schedule ‘nothing’ for approximately two hours a day, to deliberately create space for slowing down the mind. The Japanese invented the idea of Shinrin-yoku or ‘forest bathing’, a conscious act of reducing stress levels by walking silently through a forest and bringing awareness to every flora and fauna that crosses their path. The magnum opus of yoga, Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra, begins with this truism: yogas citta vrtti nirodhah, which means yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind. Practise this, and blissful beauty shines through us because we no longer feel the need for overthinking, people-pleasing, self-sabotaging, negative thinking and manic activity, or being consumed by the malaise of striving for outer perfection. Slowing down the pace of life means you add time to savouring those moments; decreasing speed means you increase clarity, patience and the ability to be planted firmly in the now. When we honour ourselves, our true selves, from a deep place of self-love and self-care, the inner glow of beauty is perceptible to all. The biggest joy is to have the capacity to be enchanted, to be in a state of awe and wonder. That is what brings that twinkle to the eyes, those positive vibrations and the warm aura of happiness—all unpretentious qualities of true beauty.

Sometimes the actor even takes to Instagram to share her favourite yoga asanas. In a recent video she posted, she showed her followers how she maintains her strong core with a deep core workout. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Using only a few tools, like a yoga mat and a dumbbell, she performed a series of exercises that, if done consistently, can strengthen the core and pelvic floor muscles. First, she twirls the dumbbell around her waist, passing it from one hand to another. Then holding the weight above her head, she lifts her legs to her chest one by one. In the next one, she brings the weight to her chest, bends her right leg and keeps her left one straight. In the last exercise, she moves her arms along with one leg and brings the weight to her chest. Malaika Arora suggests doing these four exercises for three reps, moving for 40 seconds and resting for 20. This routine takes under 30 minutes and can be done at the gym, in your home or on the go. We break down all the moves below. To start with something easy, she stands on the yoga mat with her feet at a hip-length distance. Choosing a suitable weight, she holds a dumbbell in one hand. Moving that hand behind her, she switches hands at the back and brings the dumbbell to the front. Then she switches the hand again, moving the dumbbell in circles around her. Once she completes moving the dumbbell clockwise, she moves it anti-clockwise. Coming back to a standing position, she lifts the weight above her head and keeps her arms straight. Without moving her hands, she lifts one leg and brings the knee to her chest. Putting it down, she lifts another leg—repeating this a total of 20 times on each side. This simple exercise works on the upper abdominal muscles with the weight adding to the intensity. Standing with her feet far apart, she lifts the dumbbell above her head with both hands. Pulling it down to her chest, she also bends towards the left side keeping her right leg straight. Then she stands up and lifts the weight above her head again. Then she moves to the right side, bending her right leg this time. Keeping her left one straight, she moves the weight to her chest. In the last exercise, she holds the dumbbell above her head. Balancing on her right leg, she moves her left knee and the weight to her chest closing her body. Then she throws them back, opening it up. After repeating this move on one side, she continues it on the other side. While moving her right leg, she balances on her left one. Together, this circuit helps one achieve a tighter, stronger core.

Packed with fatty acids and vitamins, the elixir has been a staple in hair care routines since ancient times. Here’s how to use it to maximise its benefits for your hair. Intensive nourishment: Coconut oil's primary advantage lies in its ability to penetrate deeply into the hair fibre, offering intense hydration and nutrition. This is attributed to its high lauric acid content, a short-chain fatty acid that ensures rapid and effective absorption. Reduces breakage: Coconut oil strengthens hair structure, reducing breakage by forming a protective layer around each strand. This shield minimises damage from daily brushing and external aggressors like pollution and UV rays. Improves scalp health: With its antimicrobial and antifungal properties, coconut oil is excellent for maintaining a healthy scalp and preventing issues such as dandruff, itching, and even infections. Promotes hair growth: For those seeking longer hair, coconut oil is an invaluable ally. By reducing breakage and nourishing the scalp, it fosters an optimal environment for hair growth. Its moisturizing properties also help prevent dry, split ends, encouraging longer, healthier hair. Coconut oil suits many hair types, but its benefits vary depending on the hair's nature and condition. For fine hair: Use coconut oil sparingly on fine hair. Excessive application can weigh it down and make it greasy. It's best to apply it as a pre-shampoo mask to avoid any oily residue. For curly and frizzy hair: Curly and frizzy hair, often dry by nature, greatly benefits from the deep nourishment coconut oil provides. It helps define curls, reduces frizz, and adds shine and softness. For colour-treated and bleached hair: For colour-treated or bleached hair, coconut oil offers protection against damage from chemical treatments. It helps maintain moisture, prolongs colour life, and protects the hair fibre. As a pre-shampoo mask: Generously apply warm coconut oil to dry hair, focusing on the ends and the driest areas. Gently massage it into the scalp and leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight before rinsing and washing it with a mild shampoo. Oil bath: For intense hydration, create an oil bath by wrapping your hair in a warm towel after applying coconut oil. The heat will help the oil penetrate deeper into the hair fibres. Daily care: For dry ends, apply a small amount of coconut oil to the tips of your hair to nourish and prevent split ends. 10 budget-friendly hair oils that will work for every hair type and issue 7 essential oils you have to try now for healthy, glowing skin 6 serums to try this summer for fading acne scars See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast.

Take Janhvi Kapoor, for example. In a recent look, the actor upped the drama with a bold winged eyeliner, which she paired with a slicked-back bun and a red micro bindi. To define her eyes further, she kept her eyebrows neat and opted for soft brown tones for eyeshadow, blush, and lips. Malaika Arora embraced high-shine makeup in an off-shoulder gown. She crafted a subtle 60s-style winged eye with gold shimmer brightening up the inner corners. She chose glittering brown eyeshadow and glossy pale pink lips and accentuated her cheekbones with a champagne-hued highlighter. Rakul Preet Singh, Shanaya Kapoor, and Aditi Rao Hydari embraced a minimalist makeup aesthetic. Hydari, dressed in an intricate gharara set by Prints by Radhika, opted for a sheer base with bushy brows, a light coat of mascara, and a soft red lip. Shanaya Kapoor, in a pastel lehenga by Anamika Khanna, channelled clean girl beauty with soft feline flicks and fluttery lashes enhancing her eyes, rosy blush and glossy pink lips. Rakul Preet Singh showed off a fresh-faced look, which she paired with a half-up, half-down hairstyle. She kept her base light and enhanced her eyes with mascara-laden lashes. The actor wore petal pink blush and warm pink lipstick for a pop of colour. Ananya Panday, who attended the haldi ceremony for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, chose warm tones with brown eyeshadow.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories From forest bathing to cold water swimming, getting reacquainted with the natural world has been high on our collective agendas during the past couple of years. And a new fitness trend – that has garnered over 350K views on TikTok – potentially brings this craze to a peak. Say hello to quadrobics, a style of exercising that sees devotees using all four limbs, to “mimic the movements of various animals”, explains Tomi Akande, a personal trainer at UNTIL. There is method in the madness: “Quadrobics is a way of exercising that combines elements of aerobics and callisthenics,” explains Akande. “It’s designed to engage all four limbs simultaneously, providing a really effective full-body workout.” Not only does a quadrobics workout enhance strength and agility, but coordination too, since it targets a group of muscles “referred to collectively as the ‘quad’ muscles, which are crucial for a variety of daily activities and overall body stability,” says Akande. This group of muscles includes the quadriceps on the front of the thigh, the quadratus lumborum in the lower back, the quadriceps surae in the calves, and the quadriceps femoris, which encompasses all the muscles in the group and forms the major muscle mass of the thigh. These muscles are crucial for general movement and maintaining mobility as we age. According to Akande, they “help with spinal stability and lateral movement, knee extension and leg raising, and ankle control and foot movement.” While scrolling through TikTok for quadrobics videos might reveal some of the quirkier aspects of the sport—like incredibly flexible individuals dressed as cats prancing around—learning functional movement can greatly benefit our health. For instance, bear crawls, a favourite among personal trainers, involve moving forward on your hands and feet, mimicking a bear’s movement. According to Akande, this exercise alone can enhance strength, coordination, and agility by engaging the core, shoulders, and legs. Other key movements include crab walks, where you sit with your hands behind you, lift your hips off the ground, and walk forwards and backwards using your hands and feet to target the triceps, shoulders and core; or gorilla walks, where you move side to side in a deep squat position with your hands touching the ground, mimicking a gorilla’s moves. “This targets the legs, glutes and upper body,” Akande continues. Then there are lizard walks, which I found quite challenging. “Move forward in a plank position, bringing one knee to your elbow while advancing the opposite hand,” advises Akande. This complex movement engages the core, shoulders, and legs, improving overall body coordination. As someone with a weak core—many of these movements are incredibly challenging. However, as the saying goes, the more difficult something is, the more you need to do it. The beauty of quadrobics-style exercises is that they can easily be incorporated into your existing routine. Akande concurs: “It’s an adaptable and versatile workout, which is one of the reasons it’s growing so quickly in popularity,” she says. “You can customise it to suit your specific fitness levels and goals, making it accessible and engaging, which can help you maintain a regular workout habit.” Requiring little more than your own body weight, and perhaps a mat if needed, it’s a free and effective way to get fit. So, will you give it a try? If you're interested and a total beginner, Akande recommends starting with a few sessions with a professional to ensure proper form and prevent injury. Alternatively, you can explore online tutorials and videos for guidance.

The two-time boxing world champion is at her most relaxed as she shoots for Vogue India’s digital cover, spinning around in her yellow skirt and cracking self-deprecating jokes. Known for a sport associated with aggression and solemnity, Zareen’s impish wit is as surprising as it is heartening. What’s less surprising is her unwavering discipline. She is committed to getting the job done and getting it done right, posing with the ease of someone who is not just comfortable in their body but also best friends with it. Top, bottom, socks; all stylist’s own. Photographed by Prarthna Singh Both on and off camera, Zareen approaches the world with the same sincerity. She does not take herself too seriously—a quality that instantly endears her to those around her. The world champion is also a self-proclaimed foodie with a soft spot for biryani and vada pav. On set, she excitedly shares that she’s been dreaming of eating vada pav for days, adding an assortment of chutneys to her plate and asking others to not hold back either. Usually, the 28-year-old is on a strict diet, so days like this are rare. Yet, Zareen does not begrudge missing out on good food or spending less time with her family. She knows it is her discipline and determination that have led to her success so far and is resolute in her dedication to paving a path ahead, not just for herself but for women across the nation too. And it’s these women, belonging to different cities, age groups, professions and communities who interview her for this cover story. From 16-year-old Kasha Sachdev from Mumbai asking Zareen about how she dealt with her first-ever sports injury to 57-year-old Anita Mahajan from Panipat enquiring if a career in sports has an expiry date, the boxer parries questions from women all over the country. Dress, Dhruv Kapoor. Socks, shoes; both Adidas. Photographed by Prarthna Singh Açai G, 11, Aldona: At what stage did you know you wanted to box? And have you ever punched a boy outside the ring? Nikhat Zareen: I started boxing when I was 13 years old. I’ve never punched a boy intentionally, but I did fight with a boy outside the ring. He was trying to be over-smart and I showed him his place. Nupur Kanoi, 45, Kolkata: What goes through your mind when you’re in the boxing ring? How do you centre yourself? Nikhat Zareen: Whenever I enter the ring, my only thought is: “Nikhat, you need to win this bout at any cost.” Whenever my focus is diverted, I try to motivate myself by thinking, “Nikhat, come back, you have to win this match. You can’t give up so easily.” Parnika Agarwal, 21, Pilibhit: When I was in school, girls playing sports were never considered to be on the same level as boys, which was very discouraging. How do you motivate yourself or what do you do to feel better when things get too difficult? Top, Bloni. Skirt, Bodice. Photographed by Prarthna Singh Nikhat Zareen: When I started boxing, people used to tell me it was a male-dominated sport and that I had no future in it. But I always believed in myself. If you do not have that belief in yourself, you cannot succeed. It also takes a lot of hard work to make it in such a field. Whatever I am today is because of my hard work and self-belief. Khatisha Yusuf Khan, 34, Ladakh: What has been a particularly memorable fight in your career? What did you learn from that fight? Nikhat Zareen: Last year, when the world championship was happening in New Delhi, I was facing a Vietnamese boxer in my final bout. I had lost to her once in the 2019 Asian Championship semi-finals, so I was a bit nervous going up against her. When I won that match, I was so happy and emotional because I also won in front of my parents. That day, I realised that nothing is impossible. I got my revenge and I was happy to defeat her. Of course, we hugged each other right after. Anju Mankotia, 59, Chandigarh: Can you tell us about a big sacrifice you had to make? Nikhat Zareen: I’ve sacrificed a lot to be where I am today. The biggest sacrifice is staying away from my family. I love children and speaking to my sister’s children on the phone makes me really emotional because I’m not there to spend their childhood with them. I miss these things, but I know what my goal is and I know my sacrifices will be worth it when I achieve it. If I win, my parents and family will be happy. In the end, I’m doing all these things to make my parents proud. Akshita Bhanj Deo, 30, Baripada: What do you believe are the key qualities and attributes that can empower women to take on leadership roles in sports? Top, bottom, socks; all stylist’s own. Shoes, Adidas. Photographed by Prarthna Singh Nikhat Zareen: I believe we women are strong in our own ways, be it physically or mentally. We also need to have empathy and understand each other’s problems to motivate each other. Those in leadership roles should not only support successful athletes, but also those who are going through a tough time or need help financially. When we support them, they will inevitably make our country proud. Kasha Sachdev, 16, Mumbai: What advice would you give an athlete who is currently dealing with her first-ever sports injury and struggling to keep up mentally and emotionally in the recovery period? Nikhat Zareen: I know this phase is tough because I’ve been in this situation. In 2017, I faced an injury and had to undergo surgery. I was so low, both physically and mentally. I was disturbed but I kept reminding myself that everything happens for a good reason. I took the injury positively, thinking it had come to teach me something. I finished my physical rehabilitation and made a strong comeback. I believe an injury teaches an athlete a lot, and you return as a completely different athlete. Since my comeback, I’ve won medals in all my competitions. When I look back on those days, I feel very proud that I didn’t give up. Never give up—just keep going and your time will come. Anita Mahajan, 57, Panipat: Do you think a career in sports comes with an earlier expiry date? Nikhat Zareen: An athlete’s career is definitely short, but it also depends on many factors. If an athlete is not physically and mentally fit and faces a lot of injuries, their shelf life will decrease even further. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important to ensure a prolonged career as an athlete. I say this, but I’m stuffing myself with vada pavs. Top, leggings, jacket; all Adidas by Stella McCartney. Shoes, Adidas. Photographed by Prarthna Singh Ritu Chhabria, 45, Bengaluru: How do you enhance your performance? Nikhat Zareen: By being disciplined, eating healthy and ignoring junk food. Madhavi Zamindar, 58, Indore: What do you think is the best way for a parent to support their child’s dreams? Can you tell us about your experience with this growing up? Nikhat Zareen: I was always a very active child and wanted to do something in sports. My dad was a sportsman himself, so he understood my feelings and supported me. That’s how I am a world champion today. I think every parent should support their kids, no matter what field they want to pursue. If parents support their children, their kids will make them proud one day. Kashma Goyal, 29, Delhi: Since sports as a whole is a male-dominated arena, did you ever feel like you had to work harder than your male counterparts on the path to success? Nikhat Zareen: I was the first girl to start boxing in my district. Fortunately, I didn’t face any comparison to men. In fact, there were boys who used to motivate me by doing partner training with me. It’s because of their support that I could adopt these techniques early. Because of their support, I could win the state championship within one year and also win the world boxing championship in the junior category in 2011. Top, Bloni. Photographed by Prarthna Singh Saachi Gupta, 23, Mumbai: It’s known that your favourite food is biryani. What is your least favourite food? Nikhat Zareen: I am a big foodie and will eat whatever you give me, but the two things I dislike are spinach and bitter gourd. Gunreet Kaur, 27, Bhatinda: How do you celebrate after winning a tournament? Nikhat Zareen: I celebrate with my teammates by eating lots of sweets, cheesecakes, pizzas and burgers because these are the items usually available internationally. I can’t eat biryani abroad, so I wait until I’m home to eat biryani. Vijayalakshmi Iyer, 26, Wanaparthy: If you could swap lives with any athlete for a day, who would it be and why? Nikhat Zareen: I want to swap lives with Cristiano Ronaldo because I want to know what it feels like to be the greatest of all time.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories From custom fashions to priceless jewels, here's an unprecedented look inside the wedding of the son of India's richest man This weekend, Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding took place in Mumbai—and it’s no exaggeration to say the whole world was watching. Thousands gathered in the streets of Mumbai to watch the son of India’s wealthiest man travel from the family home of Antilla to the Jio World Convention Center for his baraat. Millions more scrolled through on social media as Kim and Khloe Kardashian posted themselves in traditional Indian clothing with a camera crew in tow. (It’s rumored the family is shooting an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.) Meanwhile, news outlets from the New York Times to the BBC sent reporters to cover the affair, and tabloids churned out articles upon articles on the family’s every move. The fervor was understandable. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, and Nita Ambani, his wife, hosted a hastakshar for their son and his fiancée in March where Rihanna performed. In the late spring, they held grand parties for their son and his fiancée in both London and on a cruise ship that sailed the Mediterranean. One had to wonder: If the pre-wedding events were this over-the-top, what would the actual wedding be like? Vogue was granted the world exclusive inside the event. Radhika says that their wedding weekend was chosen with the utmost intent. “The dates were strategically chosen from the 12th, 13th, and 14th of July upon the advice of our family pujari, who identified synchronic moments for our celebrations based on auspicious astrological alignments in both my charts as well as Anant’s,” she says. “It was a meticulous process.” Also a meticulous process? The planning: overseen by Nita Ambani alongside her daughter Isha Ambani and daughter-in-law Shloka Ambani. “My mother-in-law was the C.E.O. of the wedding, as I like to say,” says Radhika. “It was Nita’s commitment and vision that brought our entire celebration to life.” The family had several teams of event planners, as well as their in-house staff, working around the clock to orchestrate the multi-week affair. Their nuptials kicked off on July 5 with a sangeet—or, a pre-wedding event where both the bride, groom, and their families do choreographed dances on stages to symbolize their upcoming union. Radhika wore in a crystal outfit by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. (“I wanted to make a lasting impression,” she says.) Anant also opted for a look by Khosla, complete with ruby diamond buttons by Kantilal Chhotalal. Pinned on his chest was a cheetah brooch, a nod to his 3,000-acre animal rescue sanctuary Vantara in Gujarat. Isha, meanwhile, wore a custom Schiaparelli saree: a first for the French haute couture house. As the party grew late—and Justin Bieber took the stage for a private concert—Radhika changed into a metal mesh saree by Manish Malhotra. “It featured a corset that added a modern twist,” Radhika explains. “Although it was quite heavy, it was worth every moment.” Over the next few days, the couple had several poojas (or, ceremonial prayers) as well as a mehendi ceremony where the bride and her guests get their hands and feet painted with henna. Then on July 11, they held their haldi—an auspicious tradition when a soon-to-be-married couple is covered in turmeric paste for prosperity. Radhika wore sherara pants from Anamika Khanna and a dupatta (or, a stole) made of flowers. “The atmosphere was filled with joy—and a bit of chaos,” says Radhika. “Our haldi is what I hold most dear to me.” July 12 was the baraat, or, the groom’s wedding procession. Arriving at the Jio World Convention, there were musical performers and hundreds of dancers as Anant arrived on horseback. “It was out of this world. I’ve never seen anything like this,” designer Prabal Gurung, who was one of over 2,000 guests in attendance along with Tony Blair, Nick Jonas, and Priyanka Chopra, says of the baraat. “The whole room was filled with flowers and Bollywood celebrities. There was all this dancing and singing.” (Those flowers were orchestrated by event planner Preston Bailey, who made over 60 floral animal sculptures, made of Indian flowers, including monkeys, elephants, and tigers. He estimated each one took over 100,000 flowers to make. “It took many sleepless nights,” Bailey tells Vogue, who arrived in Mumbai three weeks ago in order to pull it off. Throughout the evening, people lined up to take photos in front of the installations.) After a short break, it was time for the wedding. The Hindu ceremony began with the traditional jaimala, where Anant and Radhika exchanged garlands symbolizing acceptance of one another. That was followed by the kanyadaan, or, the official moment where Radhika’s parents gave Anant their blessing to marry their daughter. Then came the phera: or, the actual wedding ceremony where the bride and groom take circumambulations around a ritual fire. Radhika describes the act as “somber yet mesmerizing.” “Each vow encompasses promises of love, fidelity, prosperity, and mutual respect, creating a foundation for our married life,” she says. Afterward came the sindoor daan and mangalsutra ceremonies, where Anant put vermillion in Radhika’s hair and tied a mangalsutra, or sacred necklace, around her neck. “This can be likened to the exchange of rings in a Western wedding,” Radhika explains. “The ceremony concluded with the aashirwad, where we sought blessings from our elders, ensuring their good wishes for our future.” For this holy moment, Radhika wore a one-of-a-kind couture look by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla in red and white, honoring the Gujarati tradition of panetar. Her ghagra was adorned with intricate floral motifs along with precious stones and sequins. Upon her head was a six-foot veil that had a delicate jaali pattern and cut-work. (“My veil was a true Zardozi marvel,” says Radhika, referencing the cultural term for gold thread embroidery.) A wedding portrait of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant. Around her neck, she wore a multi-emerald ranihaar, or bridal necklace. Radhika tells Vogue the piece is a family heirloom: “I wore the same necklace my sister and aunts wore at their weddings, and I truly believe it gave me a special strength and blessing,” she says. The groom, meanwhile, wore Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Then, it was time for the bidaai—or, farewell ceremony for the bride as she leaves her family home to move into her marital home in Indian weddings. “It's considered a bittersweet and sentimental moment that marks the start of the bride's new life as a wife and the end of her role as a daughter,” Radhika explains. She changed into a custom red-and-gold lehenga by Manish Malhotra which featured a blouse from the Indian house’s archive that was over 100 years old. The bride also tells Vogue that her trousseau was a lifetime in the making: “There are looks—dresses and jewelry, which I have planned on with my mom and sister since I was a little girl; I haven’t paid much attention to trends,” she says. On Saturday, the Ambanis held a pooja to the goddess Saraswati. “For this day I wore my favorite outfit of the whole wedding—a ghagra painted by one of my favorite artists, Jayshree Burman in collaboration with Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla,” says Radhika. “Burman intricately painted an entire world within my ghagra with Lakshmi and Vishnu at the center,” The religious ceremony also attracted plenty of international press attention: India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, attended. Sunday was the Mangal Utsav: the couple’s wedding reception which was attended by over 14,000 people. Radhika wore a gold filigree corset from Dolce & Gabbana and a constructed saree from Anamika Khanna for the final event of her wedding weekend. Now that it’s all over, however, Radhika says she has an “overwhelming sense of fulfillment.” “We’ve been friends and confidants to one another for so long, and now we are finally embarking upon our official journey as a married couple,” she says of her marriage to Anant. “I can’t wait to see what our shared life has in store.” This story first appeared on vogue.com For the sangeet, which involves performing rehearsed dance choreographies on stage, I wanted to make a lasting impression. I turned to legendary Indian couturiers for two distinct looks. For my dance performances, I wore a stunning crystal outfit by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Together with Anant before the sangeet. Their creation sparkled brilliantly under the lights. Anant performing with my family. Akash Ambani, Anant's older brother. From left to right: my sister-in-law, Isha Ambani, my mother-in-law, Nita Ambani, me, and my sister-in-law, Shloka Ambani. Nita Ambani welcoming guests. Not every bride can rely on her fiancé's family to produce her dream wedding, let alone benefit from the expertise of a mother-in-law who is an accomplished cultural visionary. The Sangeet is really what brings both sides together because we had everyone home, every day, practicing their dances, eating together and bonding.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories The duo blended their South and North Indian cultures for a scenic wedding overlooking the tranquil backwaters in Bekal Divya Ravichandran and Rajat Khare, who first met as colleagues at their workplace in the US, describe themselves as poles apart, with few interests in common. “Here we were, two individuals from completely different worlds. I, with my South Indian heritage, having grown up in different countries, and Rajat, a North Indian from Ohio and an ardent football fan who never misses a single Cincinnati Bengals game,” shares Ravichandran. As the saying goes, love transcends barriers and in their case it took a few dates for sparks to fly, before the two realised they were meant to be. With a destination wedding on the cards, that was a blend of both their rituals and cultures—Tamil Brahmin and North Indian—the couple decided to take a moment for themselves and first exchange their vows privately. “We were both keen on a traditional Indian wedding, but we also wanted to have an experience that was uniquely personal to us. So, we decided to exchange our vows on a beach in Maui, Hawaii, exactly a year from our proposal,” the bride reveals. After scouting for destinations, the couple zeroed in on the picturesque backwaters of Bekal, Kerala for their nuptials. “The idea was for it to be an intimate, fun escape that really focused on giving our guests an immersive experience of Kerala. It had to be a destination wedding that still felt like home, and Taj Bekal Resort & Spa was the perfect setting,” the couple shares. They roped in Unicorn Wedding Planners and Jasmine Multani of WealHouse Co. to plan their detailed, personalised wedding, spread over several events, from a garden haldi and mehendi sundowner by the beach, to the baraat and wedding ceremony paired with classical music by the backwaters, and finally, a cocktail party under the twinkling stars. “We were keen that our wedding be as sustainable as possible,” Ravichandran reveals. “So, we tried utilising eco-friendly elements for all the wedding stationery and favours, that could later be used as keepsakes.” Guests were welcomed with bags filled with custom scarves, candles, illustrated pouches and local snacks. “We had luggage tags printed with landscapes such as coconut trees set against the backdrop of the ocean and Kettuvalam houseboats in the backwaters.” The couple also personalised wedding favours for each guest with handwritten notes that captured a favourite shared memory. “We wanted to make sure each guest knew how much we appreciated them being a part of our celebrations.” Guests indulged in wholesome spreads that ranged from a traditional banana leaf sadhya and multi-course meals, along with Kerala-inspired cocktails like Kasargod sangria, as well as cucumber gimlets, watermelon margaritas and desserts like Bekal crème brulee, infused with locally grown cardamom. To keep guests well-hydrated, there was plenty of fresh coconut water being passed around and a special filter coffee station. When it came to curating her bridal looks, Ravichandran worked with Tanya Vohra, celebrity stylist and founder of CLAD to ensure everything was detailed to their liking. “Tanya styled us both virtually. I wanted each look of mine to be distinct with just the right blend of tradition and modernity,” the bride shares. For the haldi, she opted out of the classic yellow and instead donned a mint green palazzo set by Mishru, while her beau contrasted in an ivory linen kurta set by Dhruv Vaish. The mehendi was an equally colourful affair with vibrant decor in tones of deep red and rust. The beach lawns were peppered with stalls themed along the lines of a carnival, where guests could choose from a bazaar jewellery bar, street food, or indulge in games like beer pong and Chinese checkers. The bride went the minimalist route, wearing a muted, metallic appliqué lehenga in shades of beige by Falguni Shane Peacock paired with a bespoke Anita Dogre choker, drop earrings and maang tikka for her jewellery. The groom was styled in a deconstructed Kunal Rawal sherwani set layered with a mint green jacket. The wedding day saw a harmonious coming together of the couple’s rituals and customs, beautifully interwoven for a blended celebration. “We chose a mix of traditions such as the kasi yatra and oonjal from my Tamil-Brahmin heritage and the baraat and saath pheras to uphold Rajat’s North Indian roots,” says Ravichandran. To pay homage to her Tamil roots, the bride chose a classic ivory and gold handwoven Kanjeevaram saree with delicate zari work and embellishments. “Tanya made my dream outfit with a very special, custom collaboration between Label Advaya and Tarun Tahiliani.” She adds that while it is not typical for Tamil brides to wear a veil, she wanted to have her own ‘North Indian-meets-American bridal’ moment and added a flowy veil and bouquet to complete her ensemble. Her bridal jewels featured a polki choker with layered necklaces, maatha patti, jhumkas and stacked bangles. She kept the glam minimal with a muted lip, dewy base and loose waves. Her beau matched with an ivory silk sherwani by Tarun Tahiliani with hand embroidered motifs. The highlight of the day was the floating-like mandap that jutted out over the backwaters, done up in lush greens and pastel florals. Khare hopped on to an ATV to arrive at this baraat while Ravichandran made her bridal entry on a raft, as she later walked down the aisle to the strains of classical Carnatic music. The celebrations wrapped up with a cocktail party under the starry skies. See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

              " 'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories Call it destiny, or a universal intervention, but a decade and a half later Tehreem Anwar and Abdul Shah connected again thanks to Instagram and a cat meme I have lived my life romanticising Old Lahore, simpler times and slowness,” says Tehreem Anwar. So when it came to planning her wedding mood board, the bride’s directive was clear: “saadgi aur pyaar,” or simplicity and love. After all, the beginnings of her romance with her future husband were complicated enough. What started as two stubborn childhood friends who refused to share their toys on playdates took an unanticipated turn when Abdul Shah’s family immigrated to the USA when he was nine, leaving Anwar behind in Lahore. In many ways, their story ended before it even began. Call it destiny, or a universal intervention, but 15 years later they connected again thanks to Instagram. “Tehreem had just started modelling and one of our mutual friends posted photos of her shoot. I sent her an IG request, she slid into my DMs with a cat meme and the rest is history,” says Shah. A whirlwind long-distance relationship ensued. Anwar was pursuing her master’s in applied anthropology from the University of Amsterdam while Shah was working as a tech consultant with PwC in the US. Late-night video calls and frequent trips between two continents culminated in a proposal beside one of Amsterdam’s famous canals. As wedding planning subsumed their lives, the decision to narrow down on a destination was an intuitive one for the couple. “There is this sense of nostalgia attached to Mughal architecture; it reminds me of the beauty and culture of Lahore. I knew that when I married, it would be in one of the tiny lanes here,” says Anwar.“We wanted to stay connected to our roots and represent our culture. We never wanted to let go of that sense of belonging and home,” agrees Shah. Leaning into their traditions and familial bonds, a pre-wedding ceremony known as a mayun was hosted at Anwar’s cousin Hashim Ali’s design studio under the February sun. As a gesture of love, the bride’s phupho (aunt) spent two weeks stitching her gharara set along with the groom’s waistcoat, which was cut from the same fabric. “It was an old-school pattapatti farshi gharara in pastel orange, pink and green with a tail at the back. The kurta’s neckline was constructed with kiran, lappa and sequins with gota decorating the sleeves,” details Anwar. As the beaming bride-to-be arrived for an evening of mehendi application and feasting on laddoos, her next of kin sang Punjabi tappe, a form of semi-classical music, on dholkis. The next day, at twilight, at the 400-year-old Asif Jah Haveli, the couple’s intimate and minimal garden nikkah came to life. The brick-walled pillars were encircled with white marigolds and the arches were decorated with Baroque glass chandeliers and sheer net curtains. “We wanted the decor to be minimal and for guests to revel in the grandeur of the haveli. The idea was for it to feel warm and homely, so the focus was on the lighting,” says Shah. As dusk deepened into night, the ivory-themed evening not only served as a symbolic blank slate for the couple to start their new life but also as inspiration for their bridal attire. Anwar turned to designer Zara Shahjahan for an ivory lehenga with gota work, paired with two dupattas—a plain net offering that served as a veil and another red drape with naqshi embroidered floral jaals. Shah swapped the previous day’s mehendi green waistcoat for a pared-back sherwani and kulla (turban) from Dulha House. “The details on his sleeves matched the border of my dupatta,” shares Anwar. The couple’s walk down the aisle started with a rose petal shower over a cacophony of freestyle and bhangra for the groom, while the bridesmaids held lit diyas under a white and green floral canopy to usher in the bride. They were then seated on either side of a rose-covered purdah, perfectly aligned with the height of the haveli’s arches. As the wedding party took their places on wooden cross-back chairs with motia strings swinging in the light breeze, the maulvi asked Anwar the question of the hour: “Do you take Abdul to be your husband?” She paused, and peeking through the floral purdah, raised an eyebrow at her almost-husband as if asking, “Is this it?” His smile was all the reassurance she needed to utter “Qubool hai”. Representations of Lahori and Punjabi cultures were seen throughout the day. “The Punjabi tradition was sustained when it came to joota chupai, as my groom was robbed of his shoes,” Anwar recounts. Amidst fits of laughter, the fragrance of jalebi and ‘Piya Tose Naina Laage Re’ playing in the background, the couple created the “saadgi aur pyaar” they had their hearts set on. “What better way to have a family reunion than a traditional wedding in our home country? We were fortunate enough to bring our family from overseas back to Pakistan,” reminisces Shah. While a traditional rukhsati (the bride and groom’s send-off into married life) is bound to culminate in tears, Anwar was grinning from ear to ear. “I was walking away with the love of my life, and he with the girl of his dreams. What’s not to love?\" See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast. All rights reserved. Use of this website constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service and Policy and Cookie Statement.

              " \"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories Gurpreet Singh and Lucie Franc de Ferriere’s wedding was a twin-city affair featuring a hand made cake by the bride, made in the Airbnb kitchen the night before the wedding When Gurpreet Singh and Lucie Franc de Ferriere met, they were in a shared Uber ride to a party neither of them wanted to go to. “I still remember the first thing I ever said to him,” recounts de Ferriere of their meet-cute in New York City back in 2019. “I asked him, “On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do you want to be here right now? “A 4” he said.” “Me to”, I laughed.”” Fast forward four years later, the couple got married in June and August of 2023 in a multicultural wedding spanning Long Island (where most of Singh’s family lives) and Pessac sur Dordogne, near Saint-Emilion, where de Ferriere’s parents live and own a vineyard and bed and breakfast. During Covid and at the height of their courtship, the city shut down and de Ferriere lost her gallery job. Singh, however, through a small takeaway window at his all day cafe and restaurant, Sunday to Sunday was able to offer coffee and pastries to his loyalists. De Ferriere, having grown up around a baker mother, rolled up her sleeves and started making cakes and pastries from the cafe’s basement. Things changed when people started coming back for her pastries, and what started as a covid project became her full-time job. In January last year, de Ferriere opened her bakery ‘From Lucie’ in the East Village, and made one of her first cakes for Anna Wintour’s Christmas party. “When we first started planning our wedding, we both wanted to honour our different cultures in which we grew up,” says de Ferriere. She was raised in France by a Protestant family, lived in Rome, Italy and England before moving to New York, while Gurpreet was raised in the US by a Sikh family and had lived in New York all his life. Knowing that de Ferriere’s father is a winemaker with over 50 meat cows and Singh’s family doesn’t eat meat or drink, it made it easy for the couple to decide to have two different weddings. For the Indian wedding in Singh’s family home in Long Island in June, planning was taken over by the family. With over 400 people to cater to, the wedding cake was handmade by de Ferriere and her mother the night before the wedding in their Airbnb kitchen. The bride recounts, “My mother is the inspiration for why I became a baker, so the wedding cake had to be made by us. It was a four tier raspberry yogurt cake with basil Swiss meringue buttercream and raspberry jam turned. I wanted to stay with more traditional colours, and picked all orange and yellow flowers.” The baker is known for her whimsical cakes with natural floral elements and wholesome aesthetic. For the Sangeet, they chose Akbar, the oldest Indian banquet hall on Long Island, where the mehendi and jaggo ceremonies were held. The bride wore a green and pink sari with flowers in her hair. The next morning, the bride and her bridesmaids arrived at the Mata Sahib Kaur Gurdwara in Glen Cove before the start of the Baraat. Dressed in a red lehenga, brought all the way from India via the groom’s family, the bride hid upstairs looking out the window for the groom who arrived on a white horse. For the decor, de Ferriere turned to her friend, owner of Joy’s Flower Shop in New York, to make centerpieces with deep red peonies to match her lehenga. The wedding ceremony was followed by a luncheon at the gurdwara, and for the evening reception, she changed into a champagne gold lehenga. A few months later, in August, the couple gathered their closest friends and family from all over the globe for a three-day event in the bride’s hometown of Pessac sur Dordogne where de Ferriere and Singh got married in the same church as her grandmother. “The church hadn't had a face lift since 1890, so the whole local community, including my dad, worked for months to get it perfect enough to welcome our guests,” says de Ferriere of the romantic location. De Ferriere’s sister, who runs a wedding planning agency, was the wedding planner for the French wedding and the mood board stayed close to home: “We wanted something very whimsical, almost “old countryside British garden” look,” explains de Ferriere, who opted for three long tables at the end of the garden at her parents’ vineyard, Chateau Carbonneau, for the wedding reception dinner. The decor included long candles, old Crystal glasses and flowers inspired by her mother’s gigantic rose garden on the property, designed and assembled by Flowers by Ford. Even the handwritten wedding invites to the guests were inspired by the bride’s parents’ engagement lunch from many years ago. They came with personal notes and the table number inscribed on a polaroid photo of a shared memory with the guest. The weekend kicked off with a welcome cocktail at the Chateau de Sanse followed by the wedding at the church, after which guests made their way to the family vineyard for cocktails on the terrace where they were served oysters, jambon and cheese with wine selected specially by her father. Catering for the dinner was done by Bordeaux based Lassuderie, and this time the bride decided not to make the cake herself, instead choosing her favourite local bakery Granet Frédéric, based in Castillon La Bataille to make a giant piece-montée, a classic wedding dessert with flavours varying from dark salted chocolate, praline, to espresso coffee and lavender. In classic French style, the dinner was never ending and guests ate the desert on the dance floor, late into the night, where dancing ended at 6 am. While the food was certainly the highlight, the bride and groom also took great care in curating their wedding wardrobe that included pieces from friends, family and longtime collaborators. For the welcome drinks, the bride wore a slinky slip dress from Kamperett and a Caro Editions red hair clip and vintage Italian shoes. The groom wore a shirt by his college mate and designer KidSuper paired with Lahos trousers from another friend, Sukh Sohal. For the wedding, Lucie wore a custom Rosie Assoulin dress. She had met the designer at one of her first ever cake pop-ups, instantly becoming collaborators. De Ferriere then made cakes for Assoulin’s wedding collection launch years later, and so wearing one of the designer’s dresses for her wedding seemed serendipitous. She paired the see-through corset dress with a tea cup hip detailing and a bow tied at the back with Catbird jewellery and Mary-Janes from Suzanne Ray. As a surprise, her mother added a handmade veil inspired by her own wedding veil from the ‘80s featuring polka dots. The groom wore a classic J.Crew suit with bows sewn on by de Ferriere’s mother for him and his groomsmen to match the bridesmaids’ dresses. The wedding was peppered with familial gestures and intimate moments, from the cake to the hand-picked wine, and even the veil. See more stories Condé Nast India © 2024 Condé Nast.

Notice to California Customers - Your Privacy Rights:\\xa0 A. Consumer Privacy. The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et. seq. (\"CCPA\"), grants residents of California certain rights with respect to their personal information and requires us to provide such individuals with certain information, described in this Section 12. 1. California residents may exercise the following rights by contacting our Privacy Policy Coordinator by email at vogue-editorial@condenast.in or phone at +1 888-914-9661, PIN: 867610, or as described at the end of this document: 2. California residents also have the right to opt-out of the \"sale\" of their personal information. We put \"sale\" in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of personal information to third parties in exchange for value as \"sales,\" even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with third party businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals. If we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their personal information. Note that we can still share personal information with third parties if those transfers aren’t \"sales,\" such as with our service providers. 3. Depending on the circumstances and which service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your personal information for a \"business purpose\" (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months: 4. Depending on the circumstances and which service you use, we have \"sold\" (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your personal information in the preceding twelve (12) months: B. Shine the Light. California’s \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, gives California customers the right to prevent our disclosure of their personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business\\' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. C. Online Erasure.

According to a new report from trend forecasting company WGSN, this value-driven consumer is one of three new consumer profiles to consider when engaging with customers. Starbucks was targeting the social-media-using millennial with disposable income, said Kara Nielsen, director of food and drink at trend forecasting company WGSN. While this marketing strategy is a popular tactic, Nielsen said, it was especially enticing to young adults who would post pictures of themselves enjoying the PSL on social media.

              " \"Select Language:       A growing number of consumers are looking for outdoor activities that are less physically demanding and require little prior expertise. Enter: Soft Adventure. From backpacking, camping to snowshoeing; soft adventure activities are on the rise with a shift in demographics and a heightened awareness of health and wellness. Soft adventure activities are driving growth in outdoor participation, providing accessible routes for new participants to reap the health and wellness benefits of the outdoors. There were 881,000 new hikers in the US in 2022 alone, while participation in camping and snowshoeing increased by 12% and 21% respectively. How can brands take advantage of soft adventure activities? Tap into designing age-agnostic equipment that focuses on ease of use, comfort and inclusivity to appeal to casual participants in accessible outdoor activities. Outdoor participation is increasing steadily among Boomers, while increased focus on the health benefits of outdoor activities and societal macro trends towards inclusivity demands equipment that accommodates a diverse range of body shapes. A good or low-price point for outdoor equipment allows for first-time consumers to build brand loyalty. Soft adventure activities act as a gateway to additional outdoor pursuits, with 94% of campers and 83% of hikers participating in at least one other outdoor activity (OIA). Lean into lightweight equipment that can be integrated into a participant’s work or social life, such as hiking packs with laptop pockets. Create robust packable gear that conforms to travel-specific needs, such as carry-on luggage dimensions and security in transit, to capitalise on growth in soft adventure tourism.

              " 'Privacy Policy The Trendalytics website and services made available from Trendalytics.co or otherwise by Trendalytics are owned and operated by Trendalytics, Inc. (“Trendalytics,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). At Trendalytics, we understand that you value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience with our site and services (referred to in this policy collectively as our “Services”) satisfying and safe. This policy describes our collection of information, including personal information, in connection with our Services, and explains how we use and disclose this information. To make this policy easy to find, we make it available from our homepage. If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in our EU Citizen – GDPR Addendum (the “Addendum”). \\xa0For this Addendum, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Trendalytics Innovation Labs, Inc. (“Trendalytics”) will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. \\xa0Where applicable, this Addendum is intended to supplement, and not replace, Trendalytics’ Privacy Policy at http://Trendalytics.co/privacy-policy (the “Privacy Policy”). If there are any conflicts between the EU Citizen – GDPR Addendum and Trendalytics’ Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. Personal Information “Personal information,” as used in this policy, is information that may be used to identify an individual, such as a person’s name, email address, or credit card number. How We Collect Personal Information We collect personal information in the course of providing our Services to you, including through your voluntary, optional submissions, such as information that you provide to us at the time of registering for our Services, or through your use of our Services. When you register with us for an account, we may collect information such as your name and email address. When you pay for certain features of the Services, we may collect information such as your credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and CVV or security code number. You may also provide personal information to us in other ways, such as by requesting user support. We may receive personal information from third parties about their users, and may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about you. If we do so, this policy also governs the combined information. How We Use Personal Information We use personal information we collect to provide, improve, and develop our Services, to tailor your user experience, to respond to your inquiries or requests, to prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our Services, for research and development, to analyze trends, and for the other purposes described in this policy. In addition, we may use your email address to deliver product information and marketing messages. You may opt-out from receiving these marketing messages by following the instructions provided in the messages to unsubscribe from email communication or by emailing the address provided at the end of this policy. How We Share Personal Information We may also provide personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of providing our Services and for our other purposes described in this policy. An example of a trusted business could be an email campaign service provider. We limit the personal information shared with these third parties to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. We may share personal information with third parties (including regulatory or law enforcement authorities) in order to carry out a user’s request or if we believe that doing so is legally required or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others. If you post any of your information to a public area of our Services, please be aware that it is no longer “personal information” for the purposes of this policy, and we or anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to personal or other information , including your email address or name, to a limited set of other users through any of our privacy controls or other settings, please understand that Trendalytics has no control over how others may collect, use, or disclose such information. Non-Personal Information We Collect, and How We Use It We may also collect information that is not personally identifiable, and may aggregate personal information or otherwise render it anonymous (that is, non-personally identifiable). We may use non-personally identifiable information we collect to provide, improve, and develop our Services and otherwise to tailor your user experience, to prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our Services, for research and development, and for the other purposes described in this policy. We may use this anonymous information for various purposes and may share it with third parties. Below are some examples of the types of non-personal information we collect and some specific examples of how we use this information: Usage tracking. We may collect non-personal information from your use of our Services. For example, we may collect information about user traffic and usage patterns throughout our site, and similar information regarding the use of our Services. We may also track click-through information, such as IP addresses, from the messages we send to our users. We use the information we collect in these manners to, for example, improve our Services, to develop new products and services, to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to discourage and address abusive and fraudulent use of our Services, and to help our users with troubleshooting issues. Methods of collection. We collect non-personal information passively using technologies such as standard server logs, cookies, and clear GIFs (also known as “Web beacons”). When you visit our site or use our Services, we may send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser or recognizes a cookie that is already on your machine. We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, and to customize your experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. Also, please be aware that third parties may set cookies on your hard drive or use other means of passively collecting information about your use of their services or content. We do not have access to, or control over, these third-party means of passive data collection. If we directly combine any non-personal information gathered through passive means with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information under this policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms. Children Consistent with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Any person who provides his or her personal information to us through our Services represents that he or she is older than 12 years of age. Our Commitment to Data Security In an effort to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Please be aware, however, that no data transmissions over the Internet or other networks can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or integrity of any information you transmit to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk. Once we receive personal information, we make reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But we cannot represent or guarantee that personal information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. If Trendalytics learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Trendalytics may post a notice through the Services if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to access the Services. Trendalytics may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. Third-Party Sites and Services Our Services may contain links to and interoperate with third-party sites and services. Any links to or interoperability with third-party sites or services are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties. Any personal information that you provide to any other third party is subject to that third party’s privacy practices and policies, not this policy. We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information. Business Transfers Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of our business assets. International Visitors The Services are hosted in and provided from the United States. If you use our Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States. The United States does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and some other regions. By providing your personal information, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the United States and the use of your personal information, in accordance with this policy. Information Retention and Disposal We may retain personal information for as long as we have a business need for it or as applicable laws or regulations or government orders require us to retain it. Additionally, the Service may enable you (or other users) to save information including information that you have made public or allowed certain users to access or see. Changes and Updates We may occasionally update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.

Change a sleeve, a collar, the \\nshape of a skirt – and you’ve just designed a new \\nstyle! \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\nWhen paging through a magazine or watching TV \\nor a movie, do you notice what people are \\nwearing and think, “That looks fabulous!”  Or – \\n“Wow, that’s not a good style for her shape.” \\n \\nOne of the first steps to designing your own \\nclothes is recognizing good design and what \\nappeals to you when you see it on someone else. \\n \\nDo you often look at a garment and think, “I love \\nthat neckline”, or  “What a beautiful sleeve”, or “I \\nlove the way that skirt flows”. \\n \\nIf you do, then you are a designer! Being able to \\npick out styling details – and identify why you like \\na particular garment – allows you to get \\ninspiration from those details and use them in \\nyour own designs.\\n \\n \\n \\nIf you sew your \\nown clothes from \\ncommercial \\npatterns you buy at \\nthe fabric store, \\nyou already make \\ndesign decisions \\nregarding style, \\ncolor, and fabric.  \\nAnd when you shop \\nfor clothes, don’t \\nyou often think, “I \\ndon’t like….(the \\ncolor, the collar, \\nthe sleeves…)” ? \\nYou’re making \\ndesign decisions \\nthen, too!\\nIf you’re ready to step up to the next level and \\ncreate your own fashions, I’ll walk you \\nthrough the process of putting together your \\nown styles.  \\n \\nFashion is little more than taking simple \\ndesign elements and putting them together in \\nyour own unique way. \\nIt’s kind of like a jig-saw puzzle, or playing with \\npaper dolls.  You mix and match sleeves, \\ncollars, skirts, and so on until you get a \\npleasing arrangement – voila!  You’ve \\ndesigned something! \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\nPlanning Your Design \\n \\nThere are certain aspects of design, both \\npractical and aesthetic, to take into \\nconsideration when you plan a garment. \\nFor example, if you want to design a dress, you \\nmay ask yourself: \\n \\n• Where do you plan to wear this dress? For \\nwhat kinds of events or activities? Is it \\n“dressy”, business-like, casual? \\n• Keeping the purpose of the dress in mind, \\ndo you want it long? Short? Somewhere in \\nbetween? \\n• Where do you want the waist to sit – at, \\nabove, or below your natural waistline? \\n(this will affect the type of skirt and bodice \\nyou choose)  \\n• Do you want the bodice close-fitting or \\nloose-fitting? \\n• Do you want the skirt slim, A-line, gored, \\nfull, pleated?   \\n9 \\n \\n• Or do you want a dress without a waistline \\n– a sheath or a full, flowing style? \\n• Do you want sleeves?  If so, are they long, \\nshort, ¾ length?  Full or fitted?  With or \\nwithout a cuff? \\n• If you don’t want sleeves, how about \\nstraps? Or strapless? Or just a sleeveless \\nbodice? \\n \\nOnce you’ve decided the basic form and \\nfunction on your dress, you can choose almost \\nany combination of design elements and come \\nup with a great-looking garment.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\nElements of Design \\n \\nThe design details you’d use to distinguish \\nyour style include the shape of the neck \\nand/or collar, the length, shape and fullness \\nof sleeves (with or without cuffs), the shape, \\nlength, and fullness of a skirt, or the length, \\nshape and fullness of a top or blouse.   \\nThese style details - like bell sleeves, full \\nsleeves, shawl collars, V-necklines – can be \\nadded to a basic bodice or blouse in any \\nnumber of combinations, each creating a new \\nand different style. \\nThe examples on the next page are all basic \\nblouses – but each has different styling details. \\nOne has a Peter Pan collar and full sleeves, \\nanother has a shawl collar and short sleeves, \\nand another has bell sleeves and a V-neckline. \\nEach as a different look – but all are based on \\nthe same basic body. \\n11 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRe-arrange these basic design elements, and \\nyou can create any number of different \\nblouses!  Put the shawl collar on the full-\\nsleeved blouse, or the Peter Pan collar on the \\n12 \\n \\nshort sleeve blouse – or any other combination \\nof details you choose. \\nIf you love the neckline you see on a blouse, \\nimagine it on a dress, in a different color and \\nfabric, or on a casual top. \\nDesign is all about trying different \\ncombinations of elements until you find one \\nthat appeals to you.  \\nIt’s the details that make a great design, but \\ndon’t overdo it. \\nDon’t put too many details into one garment.  \\nThey will compete with each other and you’ll \\nlose the impact of each one individually.   \\nEach detail speaks volumes – too many \\nand you’ll have a shouting match! \\n \\n13 \\n \\nDesigning with Darts and Seams \\n \\nDarts and shaping seams \\ncan also be used as design \\nelements. \\n \\nPrincess seams are \\ncommonly used to give the \\ngarment shape and fit. But \\nthey also add style to a \\nplain sheath. \\n \\n \\n \\n                                \\n \\n  \\nThe yoke on a skirt is a shaping seam which \\nalso functions as a design detail. The yoke \\nallows the skirt to fit closely through the hips, \\nand adds detail to an otherwise simple skirt. \\n \\n14 \\n \\nYour Basic Block or Fitting \\nPattern \\n     \\n \\nBefore you design your \\nfirst garment, you’ll \\nneed a pattern block – \\none that fits you like a \\nglove. \\n \\nA pattern block, or basic \\nblock, is a simple \\ngarment, with \\nabsolutely no styling \\ndetails.   \\n \\nIt is, frankly, a very \\nboring fitting dress!!  \\nBut that boring dress is \\nlike a blank slate to \\nwhich you will apply \\nyour design magic. \\n \\nYou’ll make fit adjustments to this basic dress \\nuntil the fit is perfect – then you can add \\nwhatever details you like, to design fashions \\nthat fit and flatter you. \\n15 \\n \\nSimple Variations on the \\nBasic Block \\n \\n       \\n                   \\nDress with 2-piece look \\n   \\nThis dress is a simple \\nvariation on the basic \\nblock.   The 2-piece look \\nwith contrast skirt keeps \\nthe waist seam, adds a \\nbelt, and moves the \\nbodice darts to the neck. \\nStarting with your \\nbasic block, you’ll add \\n“style lines” and \\ndetails to create your \\nmasterpiece. \\n \\nStyle lines are \\nchanges to the \\npattern used \\nprimarily to achieve \\nthe look you want, \\nnot for fit.  \\n \\nYou can get some very \\nnice looking dresses, \\nblouses, and tops with \\njust a few style lines \\nadded to the block, \\nand details like belts, \\nsleeves, or collars.        \\n \\n16 \\n \\n                         \\n  \\n \\nHigh Waist Dress with \\nFull Skirt \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThis simple dress \\nkeeps the fitted \\nbodice with \\nflattering princess \\nseams replacing the \\ndarts for fit. \\n \\nThe skirt has soft \\npleats that swing \\nnicely – using a very \\nsimple adjustment \\ncalled “slashing and \\nspreading” to add \\nshape and fullness \\nto the skirt.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                              \\n \\n         \\n     \\n    \\n17 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe “Illusion” dress has \\nshaped panels at the \\nsides to give the \\nappearance of a \\nsmaller waist.  \\n \\nLike princess seams, \\nthe side panels not only \\nadd color and shape, \\nthe seams function as \\ndarts or shaping seams \\nto customize the fit \\nwithout the use of \\nwaist or hip darts. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n“Illusion” Dress with \\nContrast Side Panels \\n \\n   \\n18 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTunic with shaped yoke \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThere are almost \\nunlimited options \\nwhen it comes to \\nsleeves, necklines, \\nskirt shape, blouse \\nor top length and \\noverall fit.   \\n \\nUse the bodice of \\nthe basic block to \\nmake a top or \\nblouse – the yoke, \\nbell sleeves, and \\nslight flare at the \\nhem are all style \\nlines that create this \\neasy-fitting style. \\n  \\nThe yoke effectively \\n“hides” the bust \\ndarts, too, giving \\nthe top a nice fit \\nover the bust \\nwithout noticeable \\ndarts. \\n \\n                            \\n19 \\n \\n \\nOr, turn it into an \\nunstructured jacket \\nwith curved overlap – \\nit’s really just a minor \\nvariation on the bodice \\nblock! \\n \\n \\n \\nDesign is, to a great \\nextent, just a matter of \\n“mixing and matching” \\nthose elements until \\nyou have a style that \\nyou like.   \\n \\n \\n            \\n     \\n           \\nUnstructured Jacket \\nwith Curved Opening \\nand Bell Sleeves \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOr keep the casual \\nsleeveless look, but \\nmake the skirt full \\nand swing-y – a very \\ndifferent look! \\n \\n      For example, add \\nbracelet-length \\nsleeves to the 2-\\npiece look dress and \\nthe dress looks a bit \\nmore elegant. \\n              \\n \\n \\n \\nJust switch the details around, and you have a \\nnew style.  \\n21 \\n \\n All of these styles – and many, many more - \\ncan be made using the simple dress block \\ndescribed at the beginning of this chapter. \\n Learn how to do a variety of sleeves, \\nnecklines, yokes, and other design elements – \\nand you can design anything! \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\nMaintaining Balance and \\nProportion \\n \\nAs you’re choosing the individual parts that \\nmake up you dress, keep in mind proportion – \\nboth yours and that of the dress itself. Some \\nshapes will look better on you than others and \\nI’m sure that by now you have a pretty good \\nidea what works on you and what doesn’t. \\n \\n \\nIn general, the parts \\nof your garment \\nshould give a sense of \\nbalance.  A long tunic-\\nstyle top over a \\nbelow-the-knee skirt \\nseldom looks \\nbalanced.  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n23 \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\nLong over short  or short over long looks better! \\nIn a similar way, full and fitted balance each \\nother.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nA full top over a full \\nskirt is too much; it \\nadds pounds \\n \\n      \\n \\n24 \\n \\nThe same full top over a slim skirt is much \\nbetter, more balanced. Or, a more fitted top \\nwith the full skirt works well. \\n       \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFinally, keep your own proportions and body \\nshape in mind.  \\nMany larger women (like myself) gravitate to \\noversized clothing to hide their size. But in \\nreality, excess fullness just makes us look \\nbigger!  \\n25 \\n \\nTight-fitting clothing, on the other hand, often \\nlooks like we’ve outgrown the item (and \\nsometimes, that’s exactly what’s happened!) – \\nand it’s also not flattering.  \\nBut a natural fit, relatively close but not \\nbinding, with well balanced design, looks \\ngreat on everyone. \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\nDesign with Fabric and \\nColor \\n \\nThe final selections for your design are fabric \\nand color.  These are often the most important \\nconsiderations, and a change of fabric, print, \\nand/or color can make the same dress look like \\nan entirely new style. \\nThe softness, stiffness, drape, or “hand” of \\nthe fabric is a very important consideration \\nwhen choosing a fabric for your dress or \\ngarment.   \\nA circle skirt, for example, can be soft and \\nflowy, or it can stand out like a poodle skirt.  \\nDior’s New Look of the 1950’s used full, circle \\nskirts (worn with a crinoline) for a shape that \\nemphasized the waist by flaring the skirt. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\n \\n \\nA circle skirt in a soft \\nfabric drapes nicely \\n \\nThe same circle skirt, in \\na firmer fabric holds its \\nflared shape. \\n \\nFor a full skirt that hangs and moves \\nbeautifully, use a  fluid fabric like crepe or \\nchallis.  For a flared skirt, use a firmer fabric \\nlike taffeta or poplin. \\n \\nIn another example, a very soft, flowing fabric \\nwill not work for crisp-looking pleats.  The \\npleats won’t hang properly and won’t have a \\nnice, neat edge. For crisp pleats, use a firmer \\nfabric like wool or linen. \\n28 \\n \\nSome styles can be made in both soft and \\nfirmer fabrics; you’ll just get a different look \\nwith each.  \\n A gored skirt, for \\nexample, is not too full \\nand tends to fit fairly \\nclosely through the hips. \\n \\n In a soft, loose weave \\nor knit fabric, the skirt \\nwill swing and flow \\neasily.   \\n \\n \\n            \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n \\n      \\nIn a firmer fabric, \\nlike a light-weight \\ndenim, it will have \\nmore structure and \\nshape.  \\n \\nNotice how the \\naddition of a \\npointed yoke and \\ncontrast \\ntopstitching \\n29 \\n \\ngives this skirt a very Western feel – just \\nchanging a few simple elements gives you an \\nentirely different look. \\nGet to know your fabrics and how they react \\nto the construction of the garment you want \\nto make.    \\nFeel the fabric you’re considering and lift it \\nfrom the bolt. Does it hold it’s shape or drape \\nloosely?  Both are good features; you just need \\nto be aware of when and how to use them.                                                \\n \\n \\n30 \\n \\nChanging the color or print of the fabric can \\nalso make a garment look entirely new.   \\nA basic dress with waist wrap may be \\nsophisticated and dressy in a nice black crepe, \\nor light and casual in a bold graphic print. \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\nIt’s the combination of silhouette, fabric \\nand color (or print) that determines the \\n“look” and feel of a garment.  \\n \\n31 \\n \\nWhere to Find Inspiration for \\nYour Designs \\nWhere do you go to get ideas for your designs? \\nAlmost anywhere!  If you want to stay current \\nwith the latest trends, you can find inspiration \\nfrom other designers. \\nBy “inspiration”, I do NOT mean that you \\nshould copy other designers. You’ll want to \\ncreate your own look and reflect your own \\npersonality, not that of someone else.  \\nLook for specific details that you can \\nincorporate – the neckline, the hemline, the \\nfabrics or embellishments used - and use it in \\na new and different way. \\nFor example, a peplum is a nice detail that \\ndefines the waist – you can add it to the \\nbottom of a blouse or the top of a skirt.  \\n32 \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\nThe peplum top is a fresh \\ntake on a simple blouse – \\nit’s a great shape for \\nalmost every body type. \\n    \\n \\n \\nThe uneven hemline \\nand turtle-shell print \\nof the simple \\nsleeveless top update \\na straight black skirt. \\n \\nUneven or asymmetrical hems make a top, \\nblouse, or dress more interesting and can be \\nused on almost any style. \\n33 \\n \\nFollow fashion magazines on Facebook or \\nPinterest, and read print issues.  \\nIf you love celebrity fashion, watch the red \\ncarpet entrances of award shows.  While you \\nmight not need an evening gown, some of the \\ndetails can be translated into a cocktail dress \\nor more casual wear.  Look for trends, like the \\nheight and shape of hemlines, symmetry, the \\nshape of sleeves (or the lack of sleeves), and \\nthe shape of necklines and skirts. \\nMany catalogs and retailers also have current \\nfashions, designed for everyday wear.  Follow \\nyour favorites and you’ll find lots of details you \\ncan put together into your own interesting \\nstyle. \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\n34 \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\nColor-blocked Mondrian \\nDress with a ‘60’s Feel \\n \\n \\n \\nNavy Sheath with a \\nVan Gogh inspired \\nprint \\n \\nYou’ll also get inspiration from the art world \\n(the art-inspired, color-blocked Mondrian \\nsheath, above, is an example), from historic \\nfashions, or from ethnic costume.   \\nPinterest is a fabulous resource for vintage \\nfashions and ethnic designs as well as current \\ntrends.  \\n \\n35 \\n \\nExplore the World and Find \\nInspiration in Ethnic Fashions \\n \\nThe classic Chinese Cheongsam (or “Susie \\nWong”) dress was very popular in the early \\n‘60’s in the US.   \\n \\n \\n \\nThe detail I love about \\nit is the curved \\nopening on the \\nwearer’s right side. In \\nthe dress (which is a \\nvery fitted sheath), \\nthis opening hides a \\nzipper that continues \\nalong the side seam, \\nto the waist.   \\n \\n \\n \\n36 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nI’ve used it in a \\nside-buttoned \\ntop \\n \\n \\n \\nand a sleeveless \\nsummer dress – \\nthe gentle curve \\nadds interest to \\neach garment, and \\nretains an Eastern \\nfeel. \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\nHow Would YOU  Use this opening in a \\ndesign? \\n37 \\n \\nLook to the Past for Historic \\nInspiration \\n \\nI love historic clothing.   \\nThe late 1910’s and early 1920’s is a favorite \\nperiod of mine. (If you’re a fan of Downton \\nAbbey, you know what I mean).  It’s a period \\nwhen the big, Victorian full skirts gave way to a \\nvery long and slim profile.  \\nWomen were just beginning to show their \\nankles, so dresses and skirts were still \\nrelatively long.  The silhouette is long and lean, \\nand you see the beginnings of the boyish figure \\nso popular in the ‘20’s.   \\n38 \\n \\n \\nThis 2-piece dress was \\nfound in a pattern \\nbook from the early \\n20’s; it consists of a \\nvery long tunic worn \\nover a skirt that stops \\njust above the ankle. \\n \\nThe original dress has \\na pegged skirt (with a \\nvent at the hem so \\nyou can walk) and a \\nbelt that sits below \\nthe hips (upper to \\nmid-thigh).   \\n       \\n \\n \\nThe belt has to be set that low to maintain a \\nnice proportion for the overall style – \\nremember that this dress is almost ankle \\nlength and if the belt were higher, the overall \\nlength would be off-balance. \\n \\n39 \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\nThe belt is raised again \\nwhen it’s shortened to \\na tunic (here it sits on \\nthe high hip). The \\ntunic version is very \\nmodern, but retains \\nsome of the look and \\nfeel of the original. \\n \\nWhen you remove \\nthe pegged \\nunderskirt and wear \\nthe upper part as a \\ndress in itself, the \\nbelt needs to go up a \\nbit to maintain \\nproportion.   \\n \\n     \\n \\n40 \\n \\nGet inspiration from books, TV shows, movies, \\nmagazines, and online. There are tons of ideas \\nout there – put your own spin on them! \\nAlso remember to keep it simple – you might \\nfind literally hundreds of interesting details \\nthat you’ll want to incorporate into your \\ndesigns.  Don’t use them all at once!  One or \\ntwo terrific details on a single garment is \\nplenty.  (A nice neckline and sleeve on a very \\nsimple dress or top, for example).   \\nIf you pile on more details, they all get lost in a \\nsea of “stuff”.  Highlight a terrific detail by \\nfocusing on it – don’t distract the eye with too \\nmany things to look at. \\nYou don’t need pattern books – you \\ncan come up with terrific fashions, with \\nthe right inspiration! \\n \\n \\n41 \\n \\nPutting the Pieces Together \\n \\nDesigning is a lot like putting together a jig-saw \\npuzzle.  With a selection of collars, cuffs, \\nsleeves, bodices or tops, and skirt or dress \\nshapes, you can mix and match to your heart’s \\ncontent – until you create a style you like. \\nOne of the tools a designer uses is a croqui \\n(pronounced “croak – y”). A croqui is like a \\npaper doll, in that it is a basic body shape \\nwithout clothing.  \\nYou use tracing paper to draw the design over \\nthe croqui; the body allows you to maintain \\nproper proportion for your garment.  All of the \\nstyles in this book were drawn using the same \\ncroqui.  \\nThe croqui also allows you to draw your \\ngarment with a little bit of style and the \\nsuggestion of movement. The better your \\nartistic ability, the more stylized your drawings \\ncan be – as you can see, I’m not a great artist, \\nbut I can represent styling details in a simple, \\ntechnical fashion. \\n42 \\n \\nThe following page has a croqui  you can use \\nfor tracing, and to help you get started \\ndesigning your own clothing.  \\nYou can find many croquis online (just google \\n“croqui”), but most are designed for fashion \\nillustration and the body proportion is totally \\nunrealistic. If you’re designing for yourself – or \\nyour clients if you’re a dressmaker – you’ll \\nprobably want a more realistic body as your \\ncroqui.  \\nThe croqui on the next page represents a \\nfemale body with approximately 36 bust, 26 \\nwaist, and 37 – 38 hips – not fashion model \\nthin, and not plus-sized. Just “real”.  \\n43 \\n \\n                   \\n \\n44 \\n \\n \\nSo – you’re ready to get started on designing \\nyour own clothes!!! \\nPrint the croqui, get some tracing paper (or \\nplain paper – just make sure you can see the \\ncroqui when it’s behind the paper) – and start \\ndrawing!! \\n \\nThen use the patternmaking instructions at \\nClothing Patterns 101 to help you bring your \\ndesigns to life. You’ll learn how to create your \\nperfect-fitting block, and how to use that block \\nto make bell sleeves, bateau necklines, wrap \\nfronts, gored skirts – just about any design \\ndetail you can imagine. \\nHave fun!! \\n                    \\n',\n",

These hazards can affect \\nthe health and safety of workers.  \\nImportance of Occupational Health and \\nSafety:  \\nWorkplace is like a home as most workers spend at least \\neight hours a day in the there. It can be an office, factory, \\nschool, university, etc. Therefore, work environments \\nshould be safe and healthy. Workers face multiple health \\nhazards on daily basis, like: dusts, gases, noise, \\nvibration, extreme temperatures, infections, injuries, etc.    \\n1. Hazards at Workplace:  \\nHazard at workplace indicates a situation in the \\nworkplace that could cause injury or adverse health \\neffects for people and could damage the equipment \\nand environment.   \\n \\nTypes of Hazards:  \\nDo You Know?  \\nWorkplace:   \\nWorkplace refers to a place or \\nenvironment where people work e.g. \\noffice, factory etc.   \\n  \\nHazard:   \\nHazard is a general term to tell about \\ndanger or risk. Anything that is \\ndangerous or provides risk to health or \\ncauses illness is hazardous.   \\n  \\nRisk:   \\nRisk is the possibility that a person may \\nget harmed or suffers adverse health \\neffects if exposed to a hazard.  \\n \\n3  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\nFollowing are the types of workplace hazards:  \\n1. Safety Hazards  \\nSafety hazards are the most common workplace \\nrisks. They include:  \\n\\uf0a7 spills like cords, rough edges of floor mats, \\netc.  \\n\\uf0a7 falls like working from heights, ladders, \\nroofs, etc.   \\n\\uf0a7 Unsafe and moving machinery parts that a \\nworker can accidentally touch.   \\n\\uf0a7 Electrical hazards like ragged cords, \\nmissing ground pins, improper wiring  \\n\\uf0a7  Confined spaces, etc.  \\n \\n2.  Biological Hazards:  \\nBiological hazards are also known as biohazards. They include:  \\n\\uf0a7 Blood and other body fluids  \\n\\uf0a7 Fungi/mold  \\n\\uf0a7 Bacteria and viruses  \\n\\uf0a7 Plants  \\n\\uf0a7 Insect bites   \\n\\uf0a7 Animal and bird droppings  \\n  \\n3. Physical Hazards  \\nPhysical hazards are not always something that you can see \\nor touch. Physical hazards can be aspects within the \\nenvironment that can harm the body without touching it. \\nThey include:  \\n\\uf0a7 Radiations (microwaves, radio waves, etc.)  \\n\\uf0a7 High exposure to sunlight/ultraviolet rays  \\n\\uf0a7 Extreme Temperature (hot and cold)  \\n\\uf0a7 Loud Noises  \\n \\n4  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n4. Ergonomic Hazards  \\nErgonomic safety hazards occur when the type of work, body \\npositions, and working conditions put a strain on your body. \\nThey are difficult to identify because you do not immediately \\nrecognise the harm they are doing to your health. They include:   \\n\\uf0a7 Poor visual conditions/lighting  \\n\\uf0a7 Improperly designed tools  or work areas  \\n\\uf0a7 Poor body postures  \\n\\uf0a7 Improper lifting or reaching   \\n\\uf0a7 Repetitive or awkward movements  \\n5. Chemical Hazards  \\nChemical hazards exist when you are exposed to any \\nchemical preparation at workplace. These chemicals can be \\nin solid, liquid or gaseous form. Some are safer than others, \\nbut to some workers who are more sensitive to chemicals, \\neven common solutions can cause illness, skin irritation, or \\nbreathing problems. They include:  \\n\\uf0a7 Liquids (cleaning products, paints, acids, etc.)  \\n\\uf0a7 Vapors and fumes   \\n\\uf0a7 Gases  \\n\\uf0a7 Flammable materials (gasoline, solvents, explosive chemicals, etc.)  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nActivity:   \\n\\uf076 Think about places or workplaces with which you are familiar (factories, stores,  \\nkitchens, offices, etc.). List down  the health and safety hazards in all these  \\nvarious workplaces   and write in a  chart with three columns like this:   \\n \\n5  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n \\n2. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):  \\nYou must read the work processes, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and work \\nprocedures to understand the hazards and risks at workplace. SOPs are step-by-step instructions \\nthat act as guidelines for work processes. SOPs are shaped for workers to operate in a \\nformalised and coordinated way which increases productivity and reduces the risk of errors.   \\n  \\nControlling the Hazards/Risks  \\nHealth and safety are regulations and procedures intended to prevent accident or injury in \\nworkplaces or public environments. It focuses on Safety of individuals, Safety of Equipment \\nand Safety of Environment. This is also known as 3S concept of Health & Safety. The following \\npoints provide identification of hazards and precautions against injuries/illnesses in office \\nenvironments in line with the 3S concept:  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n6  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n \\nWorking Environment  \\nHazards  \\n  \\nPrecautions  \\n• \\nElectrical: cable \\nrelated issues, \\nelectric shocks, \\npower failure, short \\ncircuit, sparks etc.   \\n• \\nHousekeeping: poor  \\ncleanliness,  \\narrangement of \\nequipment, proper \\nstorage, space \\nallocation, etc.  \\n• \\nEquipment/ Sharp \\nedges/ hot surfaces: \\ninjuries, electric \\nshock, cuts, wounds \\nand burns, etc.   \\n• \\nCables: trip hazard, \\nshort circuit, \\noverheating of cables \\netc.   \\n• \\nStaff  \\nunaware \\n \\nof emergency \\nprocedures:  \\nevacuation failure, \\ndeath toll may rise \\n(severe scenario), \\nsevere \\nconsequences.   \\n• \\nPoor ventilation: \\nsmoke and odor.   \\n• \\nTemperature \\nvariations:  \\n\\uf0fc Report any damaged power cords or  power points to supervisors \\nor  managers.   \\n  \\n\\uf0fc Minimise the use of power boards and  \\nextension cables and ensure they are  not \\nacross walkways.    \\n\\uf0fc Do not attach numerous extension  \\ncords or power boards together.   \\n\\uf0fc Ask for more power points to be installed.    \\n\\uf0fc Floors, walkways, stairs and storage areas \\nshould free from obstructions    \\n\\uf0fc Emergency exits should not be blocked.  \\n\\uf0fc All floor surfaces should be properly \\nmaintained and, if required, covered with \\nnon-slip material.    \\n\\uf0fc Sufficient lighting should be provided  in all \\nareas.   \\n  \\n\\uf0fc Step stools or step ladders should be  used to \\nreach items above shoulder  level.

They help to indicate various \\nhazards that present at workplace. At the same time, they warn workers to always keep watching \\nout for those hazards by giving required information and safety instructions. Having safety signs \\nand symbols at workplace is essential. A visible instruction from a safety sign gives clear indication \\nand lessens the likelihood of accidents to employees and non-employees, and therefore creates a \\nsafer working environment.  \\nSafety signs are categorised into four areas i.e. Prohibition, Warning, Mandatory and \\nEmergency.   \\n \\n10  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n Prohibition Signs:   \\nA sign prohibiting behavior likely to increase or cause \\ndanger (e.g. “No access for unauthorized personnel”). \\nThese signs are used for “Do Not” commands. For \\nexample – to indicate that smoking is not allowed in a \\nparticular area. In the workplace they should be used \\nto reinforce instructions prohibiting dangerous \\nactivities.  \\n  \\n Warning Signs:   \\nA sign giving warning of a hazard or danger (e.g. \\n“Danger: High Voltage”). These signs are used to \\nmake people aware of a nearby danger. For example \\n– Wet or Slippery Floor, Electrocution Danger etc. \\nWarning signs of a particular hazard appear as a \\nblack band in the shape of an equilateral triangle. \\nThe background within the band is  \\nyellow with the imagery indicating the type of \\nhazard in black, positioned centrally on the sign.  \\n  \\n Mandatory Signs:   \\nA safety sign prescribing specific behavior  \\n(e.g. “Personal Protective Equipment Must  \\nBe Worn”). These signs are used to indicate actions \\nthat must be carried out in order to comply with \\nstandardized requirements for example, self-closing \\nfire doors that must be kept closed to comply with \\nthe fire risk assessment should be labeled with \\n“FIRE  \\nDOOR KEEP SHUT”. Signs indicating mandatory requirements consist of a blue circle with the \\npictogram or text in white positioned centrally.  \\nProhibition  Sign Example   \\nWarning   Sign Example   \\nMandatory   Sign Example   \\n \\n11  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n  \\n Emergency Signs:   \\nA sign giving information on emergency exits, \\nfirst aid, or rescue facilities (e.g. Emergency \\nExit). These information signs are used to \\nindicate escape routes, emergency exits and \\nfirst aid equipment. Safe condition signs \\nappear as a green rectangle or square with the \\nimagery or text in white positioned centrally.   \\n  \\n \\nSafety Signs are crucial in any work environment. The primary importance of displaying Safety Signs \\nis to prevent injury and ensure staff and visitors are well aware of the possible dangers and hazards \\nahead in certain situations and/or environments.  \\nYellow / Amber: Warning sign - Be careful; take precautions; examine  \\nBlue: Mandatory sign - Specific behavior or action; wear protective equipment  \\nGreen: Emergency / First-aid sign - Doors; exits; escape routes; equipment and facilities  \\n \\nWork Equipment and Health & Safety Requirements  \\nWork equipment is defined as any machinery, appliance, \\napparatus, tool or installation for use at work. The scope of \\nwork equipment is therefore extremely wide. Work equipment \\nis found and used in every department in the fashion and textile \\nindustry. Every year, there are a number of accidents from \\nusing work equipment. Many are serious and some are fatal. A \\nnumber of health and safety incidents take place due to \\nequipment being used in a way that it was never designed or \\nintended to be used in.   \\nDo You Know?  \\nOccupational Health and Safety \\n(OHS) \\nis \\nabout \\nprotecting \\nworkers from harm at work. \\nThis includes death & injury \\n(safety) and disease & illness \\n(health).  \\nDo You Know?   \\nEmergency  Sign Example   \\n \\n12  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\nTools, Equipment and Machines for Fashion Designing/ Apparel Industry  \\nUnderstanding of tools, equipment and machines in the workplace provides an upperhand in \\nanalysing the hazards and risks related to each item.

In Other words, Occupational health and safety is concerned with \\nprotecting the safety, health and wellbeing of people occupied in work or \\nemployment.  \\no Accident: an unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and \\nunintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury or an event that cause \\nharm to any person.  \\no Dangerous Incident: an incident in relation to a workplace that exposes a \\nworker or any other person to a serious risk to a person\\'s health or safety.  \\no Harm: Illness and/or Injury o Hazard: any activity, occurrences, processes, \\nsituations, or substances that is an actual or potential cause or source of harm  \\no Risk: the probability of occurrence of injury or damage; Safe: means free \\nfrom any hazard.  \\no Workplace: Any premise where work is carried out, by one or more persons \\nand includes premises used for the storage of tools, machinery, equipment or \\nsubstance.  \\n \\nOrganising workplace as per OHS standards  \\nGetting your space organized can increase your productivity and minimize your stress level. Once \\nyou establish a systematic method of keeping things in order, you will save time and energy. Five \\nminutes spent planning and organizing at the beginning and end of each workday will keep things \\nunder control.  \\n  \\n \\n31  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n• \\nOffice Cleansing: De-clutter (free) your workspace from extra items. Empty the drawers, \\nshelves and desktop. Throw away the waste material. Get rid of everything that you don’t \\nneed or want.   \\n• \\nCollect and Redistribute: Gather up every item that is not where it belongs. Put it where \\nit does.  \\n• \\nEstablish work “zones”: Decide the type of activity that \\nhappens in each area of office. You will probably have:  \\no  A main workspace (most likely your desk).  \\no Reference area (filing cabinet, shelves, binders). \\no Supply area (closet, shelves or drawers).   \\no Place the appropriate equipment and supplies in the \\nproper area as much as possible.  \\n• \\nProximity: Close proximity means the nearness or closeness between equipment and items. \\nPosition the equipment and supplies that you use most within reach. Things that you rarely \\nuse can be stored or put away.  \\n• \\nLabel Things: Labeling things and files/folders is a good way to maintain your workspace. \\nFollow the given tips for labeling:   \\no Choose a label maker that’s simple to use.   \\no Take the time to label shelves, bins, baskets drawers. Not only will it remind you where \\nthings go, but it will also help others who may have a need to find, use, or put away \\nanything in your workspace.  \\no If you have paper work included in your office work, make separate files and label them \\naccordingly i.e. customer name, order name, date, deadline etc.   \\n• \\nFiling System: This is digital age and the need to store paper files has decreased. Review \\nyour digital files; there might be some files that are outdated and no longer in use. Back up \\nold files and data and remove them from your system as they may be consuming your \\nsystem memory. Store the paper work, if included in office work, into the shelves or storage \\ncabinets properly.  \\n  \\nGood to Remember  \\nBefore throwing anything, discuss \\nwith your supervisor or manager, \\nas they might need that specific \\nthing or file in the long run. If they \\nwant it in the long run, ask them \\nthe appropriate place to store it.  \\n \\n32  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n• \\nMeeting Folder: Meetings folder should be maintained and put all “items to be discussed” \\nin there along with items that need to be handed off, reports that need to be given, etc. It’ll \\nhelp you be prepared for meetings and save you stress in the event that a meeting is moved \\nup.  \\n• \\nClear the Desk: Organize and maintain your desk/workstation by:  \\no Remove everything, clean it thoroughly and put back \\nonly those items that are essential for daily use.  \\no Put items that are not in regular use in store or storage \\nshelves.   \\no Organize your desktop.   \\no Use desktop organizers or containers to organize the items on your desk.   \\no Use trays for papers and containers for smaller items.  \\n \\n \\n \\nGood to Remember  \\nStraighten your desk: At the end \\nof the day do a quick straighten, so \\nyou have a clean start the next day  \\nExample of Organized Sewing Workspace (Industrial)   \\nExample of  uno rgani s ed Sewing Workspace (Domestic)   \\n \\n33  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n• \\nOrganise Drawers: Organizing drawers are also an important part. Do not think that drawers \\nare a hiding spot and you can fill it with everything that is \\nnot in use. Remember that drawers are made to place things \\nin an order so whenever you require them, they are in easy \\napproach. Cluttered drawers may give you a hard time in \\nfinding the thing you need and it wastes your time. \\nOrganize your drawers by:  \\no Putting items used together in the same drawer space, \\nstamps with envelopes, sticky pads with notepads, etc.   \\no Using drawer organizers for little items – paper clips, \\ntacks, etc.   \\no Using a separate drawer for personal items.   \\n• \\nClear Piles: Piled up paperwork and files gives an untidy look and shows an irresponsible \\nbehavior. Follow these steps to give a tidy look by clearing the piled work:   \\no Go through the pile (a little at a time if necessary).   \\no Put it in the appropriate place or dump it (if no further in use).  \\n• \\nMail: Mails are an important part of being an employee. You get mails from your clients, \\nmanagers, supervisors or colleagues who are working with you on a same project. It is a best \\npractice to sort mail as soon as you get it. As it digital era, emails are fastest way of \\ncorrespondence. Take some time out and read the emails on daily basis. Reply the emails that \\nneed your attention.  \\n• \\nStorage Boxes: Storage boxes are really helpful in storing unwanted \\npaperwork, files and folders etc. Use storage boxes to keep archived \\nfiles and get them out of your current file space. Label the storage \\nboxes so it would be easy to locate them later. Storage boxes can \\nalso be used for storing. \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\nExample of Organized Sewing  \\nWorkspace (Domestic)   \\n \\n34  \\nCHAPTER 1:                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\nThere are several types of hazards that need to be considered at workplace.

Drawing is the solution for it.   \\n“Drawing is all about how you perceive the world around you and interpret it into your own \\nwords.”  \\n  \\nBasics of Drawing  \\nIt is impossible to make a drawing unless the artist has a clear understanding of the type of drawing \\nthat is to be created, and the visual language that is to be used which will give form and expressive \\ndynamics. If you organise the lines, you can make shapes; and when you carry a bit further and \\nadd dark and light shading, your drawings begin to take on a three-dimensional form and look \\nmore realistic.   \\n \\n \\nTools and Equipment used for Drawing   \\nOne of the great things about drawing is that you can do it anywhere, and the materials are very \\ninexpensive. Following are the tools and equipment which are used for drawing:  \\n  \\n1. Sketch Book/Sketch Pad  \\nSketch Pads are available in a wide variety of sizes, textures, \\nweights, and bindings. They are particularly handy for making \\nquick sketches and when drawing outdoors. Smooth- to medium \\ngrain paper texture is often an ideal choice.  \\n  \\n \\n  \\nDrawing is one of the oldest forms of human expressions  \\n  \\nDo You Know?   \\n \\n61  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\n2. Pencil  \\nPencils are available in three basic families HB, \\nB and H. The softer B Pencils are generally \\nconsidered the best for shading. The HB and H \\nare good choices for fine, light, even shading. \\nPencil grades from HB through H, 2H to 5H get \\nprogressively harder and are easier to keep \\nsharp.  \\n  \\n3. Charcoal   \\nCharcoal is available in two forms: Charcoal stick and \\nCharcoal pencil. These are essentially charred wood \\nand are one of the oldest drawing materials. These are \\nmade of carbonized wood, the sticks are graded as soft \\nor hard and available in four thicknesses: thin, \\nmedium, thick, and extra thick sticks. Thin sticks work \\nwell for fur, feathers, and other fine detail, while \\ncharcoal pencil works well for large areas and minor details.  \\n  \\n4. Sharpening Tools   \\nSharpeners are available in variety of forms. These are used \\nto sharp wooden-barreled pencils, charcoal pencils, etc. They \\nallow you to sharpen the point of your medium to suit the type \\nof work you are doing.  \\n  \\n  \\n5. Erasers   \\nErasers are useful for rubbing out mistakes or for blending. \\nHarder plastic or vinyl erasers pick up less pigment and \\nstay cleaner. They can be used on their edge to make crisp, \\nincised lines in areas of deep tone; alternatively, use the \\n \\n62  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\nsharp corners to  make patterns and describe texture. They also remove stubborn pencil or graphite \\nmarks and small errors.   \\n \\n  \\nInteresting Information  \\nA kneaded eraser is an integral part of drawing. It can be formed into small  wedges \\nand points to remove marks in very tiny areas. Vinyl erasers are good for  larger \\nareas, they remove pencil marks completely.  \\n \\nConcept of Still Life  \\nStill life drawings offer a great opportunity to \\nlearn and practice a variety of drawing skills, \\nincluding developing form, applying shading, \\nand using perspective. Still life compositions \\ntraditionally depict a carefully arranged \\ngrouping of a number of household objects, \\nsuch as fruit, vegetables, glassware, or pottery, \\nall of which offer a wide range of textures, \\nsizes, and shapes. But you do not have to restrict yourself to traditional items, use your artistic \\nskills to get as creative as you want.  \\n \\n \\nYou can practice your skills of drawing through proportions by using different objects such as \\nshoe, glass, bottle, jug, stool, chair, vase, etc.  \\n   \\nLine Proportion and Perspective of Object in Still Life  \\nCreating a good still life composition is simply arranging the elements of a drawing in such a way \\nthat they make an eye pleasing and harmonious scene. It makes easy to draw by following a few \\nguidelines:  \\nDo Yo u Know?   \\n \\n63  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\n1. Choosing a format that fits the subject.  \\n2. Establishing a center of interest and a line of direction that carries the viewer\\'s eye into and \\naround the picture  \\n3. Creating a sense of depth by overlapping objects, varying the values, and placing elements \\non different planes.   \\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nInteresting I nformation   \\nComposing still life is a great experience because you select the lighting, you  \\nplace the elements where you like, a nd the objects do not move .  Test out the  \\narrangements in small, quick thumbnails, like the ones shown below. These  \\nstudies are invaluable for working out the best possible composition.   \\nActivity - 3.1 :   \\nDraw Still Life   \\nStep One : From your thumbnail  \\nsketches, choose a horizontal format.  \\nNotice that the tureen is set off - center ,  \\nif the focal point were dead center,  \\nyour eye would   n o t be led around the  \\nwhole drawing, which would make a  \\nboring composition. Then lightly  \\nblock in the basic shapes with most ly  \\nloose, circular strokes, using your  \\nwhole arm to keep the lines free.   \\n \\n64  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\n \\n  \\n  \\nStep Three:     Continue adding details  \\non the tureen and darkening the cast  \\nshadows. Then start shading some of  \\nthe objects to develop their forms.  \\nYou might want to begin with the bell  \\npepper and the potato, using the point  \\nand side of an HB pencil.   \\nStep  four :   Build  the forms of the  \\nother vegetables, using a range of  \\nvalues and shading techniques. To  \\nindicate the paper skins of the onion  \\nand the garlic, make strokes that  \\ncurve with their shapes. For the  \\nrough texture of the potato, use  \\nmore random strokes.    \\nStep Two :   Next refine the shapes of  \\nthe various elements, still keeping  \\nyour lines fairly light to avoid creating  \\nharsh edges. Then, using the side of an  \\nHB pencil, begin indicating the cast  \\nshadows, as well as some of the  \\ndetails on the tureen.   \\nStep  five :  Whe n you are finished  \\ndeveloping the light, middle, and  \\ndark values, use a 2B pencil for the  \\ndarkest areas in the cast shadows (the  \\nareas closest to the objects casting  \\nthe shadows ).   \\n \\n65  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\nPerspective of Object:  \\nDrawing is actually quite simple, just sketch the shapes and masses you observe. Sketch freely. If \\nyou discover something wrong with the shapes, you can refer to the rules of perspective below to \\nmake corrections. Your drawings do not need to be tight and precise as far as geometric perspective \\ngoes, but they should be within the boundaries of these rules for a realistic portrayal of the subject. \\nYou need to learn different types of perspectives which are given below:   \\nOne Point Perspective: In one point perspective, all the lines that are not vertical or horizontal \\nvanish into one point in the image. This point is often located in the middle of the picture but it \\ncan be anywhere.   \\nTwo Point Perspective: In two point perspective, all non-vertical lines vanish into two points of \\nthe same height at the border of the image.  \\n \\n  \\nLet ’ s See , If you can identify  \\nONE POINT & TWO POINT  \\nperspective…….   \\n \\n66  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\n \\n \\nShading Techniques  \\nThere are many ways to shade with pencils. The \\nfour main techniques generally used are \\nshading, hatching, cross-hatching and following \\nthe form. Each one is demonstrated below.  \\n  \\n1. \\nShading:  Shading with a pencil when \\nmarks are very close together so that they form \\na continuous tone on paper.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2. \\nHatching:  Hatching with a pencil when \\nhave a gap between each mark and arrange them \\nin a way to create continuous coverage.   \\n  \\n3. \\nCross-hatching:  Cross-hatching with a \\npencil when pencils are crisscrossing lines to \\ncreate coverage. Try experimenting with \\ndifferent coverage techniques.  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n You can practice shading by arranging  \\nvarious things such as jewellery box, pencil \\nbox, book shelf, etc.  \\n  \\n  \\nDo You Know?   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nInteresting I nformation   \\nThe Points in which the horizontal & vertical lines merge are called vanishing  \\npoints.  \\n \\n67  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 3:                                                                                                 DRAWING - I \\n \\n \\n  \\nNature Drawing  \\nNature drawing is recording a scene/situation that is moving and lifelike. Think animals/birds/trees \\nalways in motion and must be sketched quickly. Nature is everything that is not man-made and it \\nencompasses the universe. Framed landscape-type pictures always look enchanting on any wall. \\nWhen you study the landscape outdoors, remember that you will never see a true straight line, it is \\nonly man who makes things through mathematical perspective.

The ones that we see are the colors of the \\nvisual spectrum i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Objects absorb certain wavelengths \\nof light and reflect others back to the viewer. We perceive these wavelengths as color.  \\n  \\n1.2 Colour Wheel:  \\nColor wheel is the abstract illustrative \\norganization of color hues around a \\ncircle that shows relationship between \\nprimary, secondary and tertiary colors. \\nOn the color wheel red, yellow and blue \\nprimary colors are arranged at three \\nequally spaced points and secondary \\nand tertiary colors are arranged between them.  \\n  \\n1.2.1 Difference between Primary, Secondary and \\nTertiary Colours  \\n\\uf0ad Primary Colors:  \\nPrimary colors are not mixed from other \\nelements and they generate all other colors.  \\n\\uf0fc  \\nRed \\n\\uf0fc \\nYellow  \\n\\uf0fc \\nBlue  \\n  \\nPoint to Ponder! \\nKeep in mind that the color mixtures above only work if you use the purest form of \\neach primary color.

When designing or even painting with primary colors, don\\'t feel  \\n  \\nrestricted to just the three primary colors listed above. Orange isn\\'t a primary color, for example,  \\n  \\nbut brands can certainly use orange as their dominant color. Knowing which primary colors create  \\n  \\norange is your ticket to identifying colors that might go well with orange -- given the right shade, \\ntone, or tint. This brings us to our next type of color  .   \\n  \\n\\uf0ad \\nSecondary Colours:  \\nSecondary colors are the colors that are formed by combining any two of \\nthe three primary colors listed above. Check out the color theory model \\nabove -- see how each secondary color is supported by two of the three \\nprimary colors? By mixing two primary colors, a secondary color is \\ncreated.  \\n  \\n\\uf0ad \\nTertiary/Intermediate Colours:  \\nTertiary colors are created when a primary color mixes with a \\nsecondary color that comes next to it on the color wheel. There \\nare six tertiary colors that are given below:  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n81  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 4:                                                                                   BASICS OF DESIGNS \\nInteresting Information \\nThe most important component of tertiary colors is that not every primary color \\ncan match with a secondary color to create a tertiary color. For example, red \\ncan\\'t mix in harmony with green, and blue can\\'t mix in harmony with orange -- \\nboth mixtures would result in a slightly brown color  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1.3 Temperature of Colour:                                   Interesting Information                                                            \\nColour temperature is the warmness or  \\n \\n\\uf0a7\\uf020Warm colors are found on the right \\ncoolness of a colour.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nside of the color wheel   \\n\\uf0a7\\uf020Cool colors are found on the left side of \\nthe color wheel.  \\n1.3.1 Warm colours:  \\nWarm colors are associated with the fire, heat, sun and warmer temperature.

Objects, values, colors, textures, \\nshapes, forms, etc., can be used in creating a balance in a composition.   \\n \\nTypes of Balance  \\nBalance is of two types:  \\n• \\nFormal Balance (Symmetrical)  \\n• \\nInformal Balance (Asymmetrical)  \\n Formal Balance (Symmetrical)  \\nIn formal balance elements of designs are equally distributed across both sides of a design in terms \\nof number, shape, colour etc. Butterfly is the best example of formal balance. It is created by \\nrepeating the reverse of a design on the opposite side of the vertical axis; each side, in essence, \\nbecomes the mirror image of the other. Symmetrical balance is considered formal, ordered, stable \\nand quiet. It is often used in architecture.  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nInteresting Information   \\n\\uf0a7 \\nAs a design principle, balance places the parts of a visual in an aesthetically pleasing  \\narrangement.

Geometric shapes design \\nwith circles, triangles, squares, rectangles, and many other \\nshapes often combine to form beautifully intricate patterns. \\nEven if you only use a few shapes in your design, there are so many possibilities as to what you \\ncan create.

Anyone can learn to draw with proper practice and diligent hard work. So not \\nknowing drawing should not be an excuse not to pursue your dreams.  \\n   \\n  \\nFashion Croquis  \\nThe first step in fashion figure drawing is to create a \\nfashion croquis. A croquis is a quick sketch outlining \\nthe proportions of the fashion figure. A croquis is \\nalmost like a paper doll, it is a template and can be \\nplaced under a piece of paper for drawing garments. \\nFashion croquis can be all different shapes, sizes, and \\nstyles. It all depends on the end use of your design and \\nthe demographic you are designing for.  \\n  \\n  \\nFashion Drawing - I \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n121  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 5:                                                                               FASHION DRAWING - I \\nProcess of drawing basic 9 heads fashion figure  \\nThe standard Croquis is an elongated figure with \\nlonger legs, a smaller head, and thinner hips than the \\naverage woman. The croquis is 9 heads tall from the \\ntop of the head to the ankles. (The feet are excluded \\nfrom the equation since they can vary in height \\ndepending on type of shoes and heel height.)  The point \\nof view is that a fashion model’s length and simplicity \\nof form help to display clothing with a dramatic effect. \\nThe design intent of a garment is exaggerated when \\ndisplayed on an elongated scale, and this elongated \\nscale helps to portray a fantasy.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThings to Remember while Studying Fashion \\n \\n  \\n \\no Balanced approach and originality   \\no Portfolio development    \\no Talk to your peers   \\no Stay in touch with latest trends.   \\no Research   \\no Know latest technologies    \\no Internship   \\n \\n \\n  \\n122  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 5:                                                                               FASHION DRAWING - I \\nApplication Process of Drawing Basic 9 head and 10 head   \\n \\n \\n10 headed fashion figure is also used in the fashion drawing, the Process is almost same as \\ndiscussed below in the 9 headed Croquis.  \\nDo You Know?   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nStep 1:   Draw 9 heads that are  \\nroughly the same shape and size  \\nand label 1 - 9 .  leave some space at  \\nthe bottom of the page \\n  for the feet.   \\nStep 2:   Draw horizontal lines  \\nbetween  each head (make sure  \\nthey are straight)   \\nStep 3:   Add a dashed line at  \\nroughly 1  1 2 \\n/ ” and 4  \\n1 4 \\n/ ” heads   \\nStep 4:   Label   anatomy as marked  \\non this page   \\n  \\n  \\nPart 1: Creating Guidelines \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n123  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 5:                                                                               FASHION DRAWING - I \\n \\n  \\n  \\nStep 1:   Draw ovals for the shoulder,  \\nbicep, and lower arm \\n  \\nStep 2:   Draw ovals for the upper and  \\nlower leg    \\nStep 3:   Draw triangles for the feet  \\n  \\nStep 4:   Add shape to the neck and outline  \\nthe arm, using the ovals as guidelines.  \\nRepeat on other side   \\nStep 5:   Outline the leg and foot as  \\nillustrated, using the ovals as guidelines.  \\nRepeat on other side  \\n  \\nStep 6:   Add neck, bus t, and  pelvis   line as  \\nillustrated.   \\nStep 7:   Add center line at each side of  \\nbody as illustrated.

And unstylish hair \\ncan date your drawing in a nanosecond. As a trendy fashion illustrator, \\nyou definitely don’t want people thinking your art is outdated.  \\n• \\nHair grows out of the head. This point may sound obvious, \\nbut many people tend to draw hair that’s contained within the original \\noval they sketch for the head. Hair grows out of and extends beyond \\nthe head.  \\n• \\nHair falls across the face and head. Again, this fact may sound \\nobvious, but many illustrators draw hair coming from the outside oval \\nof the head. Hair grows from your forehead, temples, and the sides of \\nyour head, so it covers part of the oval that makes up the face.  \\n• \\nThe hairline follows the natural contours of the head.

You can also hint at the knuckles \\nof the outer side of the wrist.  \\n  \\nThe process of drawing feet  \\nDrawing feet can be difficult. With a padded bony \\nheel, a long, arched set of metatarsals and flexible \\ntoes, the human foot is made up of a lot of varied \\nelements, and it may seem like a challenge to put all \\nthese different parts together.  \\nBut like any other subject, the foot can be broken \\ndown into different forms before the details are \\nadded, no matter what perspective you approach it \\nfrom.  \\n1. Top plane  \\nWhen viewed from above the plane of the top of the foot slopes away from the ankle down to the \\ntoes. Draw the overall shape that the toes will fit in first, and then divide that space up with lines \\nbetween the toes.  \\n2. Inside plane  \\nThe inside plane of the foot is approximately triangular, running from the ankle to the big toe  \\n \\n \\n  \\n136  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 5:                                                                               FASHION DRAWING - I \\nand heel. Use a rounded shape to establish the positions of the heel and ankle; the relationship \\nbetween them is important for the stability of the figure.  \\n \\n3. Underside  \\nThe underside of the foot is the kind of shape you see \\nimprinted on the sand on beaches, the curves of this plane \\nare more pronounced although it will still fit within a broad \\ntriangle  \\n4. Angled views  \\nYou’ll rarely see any single plane exclusively. Use the idea \\nof the planes of the foot to break a complex shape down \\ninto simple elements before developing the foot drawing \\nto more closely reflect what you see.  \\n5. Back of the foot  \\nThe calf muscles taper to the \\nAchilles tendon, and that in turn \\ncreates a hard edge on the back \\nof the foot as it connects to the \\nheel. You can see the ankle \\nprotruding out to each side and \\nthe foot sticking out in front.  \\n \\n \\n  \\n137  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 5:                                                                               FASHION DRAWING - I \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nBasics of Fashion Drawing/Illustration  \\nThe process of drawing basic 9Head fashion figure/Croquis  \\n  \\nThe process of drawing basic 10Head fashion figure/Croquis The \\nbasic human anatomy  \\n  \\nThe process of drawing head with different hairstyles  \\n  \\nThe process of drawing hands  \\nThe process of drawing arms  \\n  \\nThe process of drawing feet  \\n \\n  \\nhttps://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/human-anatomy-fundamentals-how-\\ntodraw-feet--cms-21733  \\n  \\nhttps://www.amikosimonetti.com/life/drawing-the-fashion-figure-with-\\n9heads-proportion-part-1  \\n  \\nhttps://www.fashionistasketch.com/draw-fashion-croquis/#comments  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nK ey Points   \\nWeb links :   \\n  \\nActivity   \\n\\uf076 Draw Feet without Model   \\n \\n \\n  \\n138  \\n  \\nCHAPTER NO. 5:                                                                               FASHION DRAWING - I \\n \\nExercises \\nTick (√) the correct answer  \\n1.

We’re so happy you’re here!   \\nWe believe that every woman should feel confdent about her everyday style.\\nYou might wonder... looking good every single day? Is that even possible? Yes \\nit is, we promise. Let’s go on a style journey together! \\nIn this magazine, we will discover YOUR personal style. A style you truly feel \\nhappy and confdent about. Do you relate to the following? \\n•\\t You are facing the dreaded ‘I have nothing to wear!’\\n•\\t Your style doesn’t feel like YOU anymore, but you don’t know why.  \\n•\\t You want to level up your outfts to look stylish and polished every day. \\nWell, than this magazine is for you! We are so excited and are cheering you on \\nas you discover easy ways to level up your every day style! \\nLots of love,  \\nPrisma Watch \\nIt’s time to make your daily style \\nricher and fuller of joy! \\nHeadstart your journey! \\nTese three principles will help you to start your style journey. \\nWe’ll discuss them all in the following pages. \\nPay attention to your current outfts \\nand identify problem areas. \\nFree yourself from ‘boxes’, ‘styles’ and ‘categories’. \\nTink about ways to start experimenting.  \\nPrinciple 1: Start paying attention.\\nTe frst principle is to start paying attention to how you feel when you wear \\nyour current outfts. Can you notice diferences in the way clothes make you \\nfeel? Be specifc! \\nMany of us say: ‘Everything is wrong with this look. It just doesn’t look right.’  \\nBut now try to pay more attention to WHAT causes you to feel that way.  \\nDo you feel like your outft doesn’t communicate the message you would like \\nit to communicate? Or is it just fne, but do you feel like you are missing some \\nsparkle? \\nSome questions to get you started: \\n1. What am I communicating with this outft? \\n2. Does this message correspond with what I believe about myself/\\nwould like to communicate towards others? \\n3. Is this outft appropriate for todays activities, and at the same time, \\ndoes it feel like me? \\n4. Do I like the color scheme of my outft today? Do the colors match \\nand do they make me glow? \\n5. Do I feel like this outft is complete, or could I have put in some more \\nefort? \\n6. Do I feel like the concept of my outft, but would I like the actual \\npieces look better on me. (Diferent color, diferent ft). \\n7. Am I fnding myself wearing this outft over and over? \\nPrinciple 2: Don’t put yourself in a box.\\n \\nNow that you have identifed your specifc problem areas when it comes to \\nyour daily outfts, you can start thinking about solutions. \\nWhat is important here is that you are open to diferent styles. How do you \\nknow if something will good on you or not, if you don’t give it a try? \\n‘But what will others think?’ \\nA common question. Ofentimes, we withold ourselves to do something, or to \\nwear something, because we are afraid of the opinion of other people. But you \\nare not a sum of all kinds of expectations of others. Start believing that people \\nwant to see the genuine, happy version of you. And if they don’t, they are not \\nthe right people for you anyway. \\n•\\t Stop putting pressure on yourself to stick to a certain style all the time. \\n•\\t Start believing that the right people want to see you thrive. \\n•\\t Believe this truth: You can have more than one style and still be stylish. \\nPrinciple 3: Start experimenting \\n \\nTink about your most common wardrobe frustrations again and see how you \\ncan start experimenting in these areas. For example: \\n•\\t For feeling bland: Look for ways to bring back the fun in \\nyour outfts. Play up with accessories, statement necklaces, big \\nbracelets and a stunning watch. \\n•\\t Looking for cheap ways to be more stylish: Focus on the little \\nthings that make a big diference, like wearing lipstick, or heels \\nthat go with your jeans. \\n•\\t Needing inspiration: Create a Pinterestboard and try to  recreate \\noutfts. \\n•\\t Need more guidelines to help you coordinate: Learn about \\ncolor theory, color coordination and ways to be more put-\\ntogether. \\n•\\t Get help: Start shopping with a friend/family member whoms \\nstyle you love. \\n•\\t Document your style journey: whenever you experiment with a new  \\noutft, make a picture of your creation. It’s easy to fall back on.\\nAre you ready to level up \\nyour daily style? \\nAction step 1: \\nAll about accessorizing. \\nTip 1:  Tink about proportion \\n•\\t Tink about appropriate proportions. E.g. if you are petite, and want to appear \\na bit taller, you should not wear too many large pieces. Same goes the other \\nway around. \\n•\\t Make sure that your accessories balance each other out. For example,  if you \\nare wearing large earrings, it might be a good idea to not go overboard with \\nyour other accessories. \\n•\\t A good rule of thumb is to stick with 1-2 statement pieces. \\nAccessories are a woman’s best friend. \\nBecause it is such an easy way to upgrade your everyday look, wearing \\naccessories it is the frst action step in our series! Above all else, wearing \\naccessories is FUN. When the pieces you choose resonate with your personality \\nand preferences, it will make you happy. \\nTip 2: Stick to a ‘‘theme’’ \\nIn order for your outft to look harmonized instead of distracting, you could \\nopt to stick to a certain ‘theme’. Tis could be as small as the theme: ‘‘Blue’’ or \\nas big as the theme: ‘‘Marilyn Monroe inspired’’ or ‘‘Surfer girl’’. \\nIt doesn’t really matter what you choose, or what your interpretation of a \\nlook is, but you get the idea: We want our accessories to look balanced and \\nto enhance each other, and thinking about a certain style or ‘look’ could give \\nyou some directions AND some more fun in the process of getting ready for \\nthe day.\\nTip 3: Tink about color \\nStyle experts advice us to wear a maximum of 3-4 diferent colors in our \\noutfts.A few color options are: \\n1. Using accessories with colors that can already be found in your outft: \\nWearing a blue bracelet with a patterned skirt that has the same color of \\nblue in it. \\n2. Using accessories with a bold color, to play up a ‘basic’ outft: think \\nabout a black dress with red earrings and red heels. \\n3. Sticking to only ‘gold’ or ‘silver’. You can never go wrong with that! Take \\nnotice of your own skin tone to determine which of the two suits you best! \\nOh darling, \\nwatch me. \\nAt Prisma, we are especially passionate about beautiful ladies’ watches. Tere-\\nfore, we have some helpful tips for you when it comes to deciding which type of \\nwatch would suit you best. \\nTere are so many diferent types of stunning women’s watches: elegant and \\nclassy, minimalistic, feminine, bold, vintage and sporty & chunky! \\nWhen you want to decide what type of watch would suit you well in your daily \\nstyle, think about the following: \\n1. What comes to mind when you describe your perfect watch?  \\nIs it small/larger, gold/silver or squared? Does it have a colored strap, a mini-\\nmalistic dial or is it sparkling with small diamonds? \\n2. To what kind of occasions would you like to wear this watch?  \\nShould it ft every occassion, or would you like to own a watch that is strik-\\ning and eye-catching for special occasions? \\n3. What type of watch fts your current styel in terms of color, look and feel?  \\nTake a look at the pieces in your wardrobe to determine what your current \\ncolor themes, looks and feels of your current style are. It helps when decid-\\nAction step 2: \\nWear clothes that you actually \\nfeel your best in.  \\nAlright, a piece of clothing \\ncan look beautiful, but do \\nYOU feel beautiful in it? \\nIt is so important to wear \\nclothes that actually ft you \\nwell, and that you feel your\\nbest in. Tis is not just about size. It is so much more than that...\\n•\\t It is about the quality of your clothing and accessories. \\n•\\t About the specifc length, width and shape of your clothes. \\n•\\t About pieces that actually compliment your features, instead of something that \\njust looks fne/okay. \\n•\\t And especially about your own preferences. \\nFor example: \\n•\\t You may look good in dark jeans, but even better in high-waisted jeans which \\nare a bit more wide at your ankles. \\n•\\t You may look good in red, but better in this specifc tone of red, than the other. \\n•\\t You may look good in white, but not so much in cream. \\n•\\t You may look good with eye catching accessories, but those sunglasses are just \\ntoo big for the shape of your face. \\n‘‘Te way to really take your outfts about average is to look specifcally at \\nHOW things look on you, and how you feel in them.’’ \\n \\nDo you feel \\nbeautiful in this?  \\nAction step 3: \\nLooking more put-together. \\nFinding ways to make yourself look more put-together is \\nactually all about the small things and routines that make a big \\ndiference. Sometimes, all a beautiful look requires is a little more \\nthoughtfulness. Do you love lists? Take a look at our tips and tricks! \\n1. A beautiful look is all about your basics \\n \\nTaking great care of your hair, skin and nails, is vital when it comes to looking \\nput-together or not.  You could wear the most elegant outft, but if your hair \\nand nails look undone, you will not communicate the radiance you are hoping \\nfor. Give your basics some love! Invest in high quality skin care and learn about \\nbeauty routines to make yourself look groomed.  \\n2. Enhance your features  \\n \\nOf course, you don’t have to wear make-up if you don’t want to, but it can just \\nadd to a little extra polish for your daily look. Opt for light make-up that en-\\nhances your features, instead of covering them.Learn the right techniques for \\napplying make-up, and you will notice a big diference in how it looks on you.  \\n \\n3. Have a routine \\nSeriously, the art of ‘having a routine’  \\ncan take so much stress away.w\\n•\\t Take the time to arrange outfts \\nand have them ready to go for \\nbusy weekdays. \\n•\\t Be consistent with your beau-\\nty routines so you never leave \\nthe house and discover a part of \\nyourself that is ungroomed. \\n•\\t Master applying make-up and \\ndoing hairstyles that work for \\nyou in ten minutes or less.  \\nSome other tips, just for fun, and to get you inspired: \\n•\\t Wear lipgloss/lipstick \\n•\\t Always wear earrings. Such a simple way to make it look like you put more \\nefort into your outft. \\n•\\t Wear dark-colored jeans instead of light-washed jeans. \\n•\\t Match your accessories with your shoes. \\n•\\t Make sure your items are well-kept. Polished shoes and bags that is. No \\nwrinkles in your clothing of course. \\n•\\t Get your brows done regurlarly. \\n•\\t Statement necklaces \\nAction step 4: \\nGet your creativity going. \\nAgain, leveling up your daily style is a journey. You will learn as you go. No \\nperfection required! Don’t forget to have lots of fun in the process! For our last \\naction step, we are going to talk about staying inspired during your entire style \\njourney. Remember, this is all about experimenting, discovering and \\n1. Follow people with great style  \\nTis is a no brainer, but follow people with great style! Regular style images on your \\nfeed can defnitely help you stay inspired. Follow a bunch of styles you like, and get \\nused to seeing many diferent kind of outft combinations.  \\n2. Look for people that look like YOU.  \\nDon’t get trapped in style comparison and also follow people who actually look quite \\nsimilar to you. Tis means following people with the same kind of body type as \\nyou. Or skin color, height, you name it... See what they are wearing, and then try for \\nyourself.  \\n3. Create a vision board  \\nVisionboards are a great way to visualize the style that makes your heart happy. \\nStart collecting images of outfts and accessories that you love. You can save images \\nin a Word document, on your Pinterest board, or you can get creative with making \\ncollages in a notebook. Also, having all kinds of images in one place allows you to \\ndiscover certain styles that you are naturally drawn to.  \\n4. Document your own outfts  \\nA nice way to have fun during your journey towards better daily style, is to document \\nyour own outft creations. Whenever you wear an outft you love, take a picture and \\nsave it for a ‘I have nothing to wear’-day rolls around.  \\n5. Go shopping with someone  \\nAgain, go shopping with someone who knows you and your personality. Someone \\nyou trust. Try one of the following: Let them pick outfts AND try them on. Go \\nshopping with someone who’s style you would love to steal! OR: Go shopping with a \\ntotally diferent style than you have. Who knows what you might discover.  \\n \\n \\nFinding your style is a journey. \\nHave fun in the proces!\\n']"
